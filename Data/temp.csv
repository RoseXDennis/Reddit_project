1360874314,"Spoken language is inherently flawed, as it can never appropriately translate emotion.","Obviously, verbal language in the form of words is just a combination of certain sounds.  Of course this system is easy for communicating physical objects in a quick and efficient way.  When I say the word ""tree"" your brain conjures up the image of a tree.  It is tangible. You reach back for a memory of what you know to be a tangible object.  Language, in this form, is indeed perfect, because when you communicate a physical object with this system, the memory it links back to is universal, and therefore universally understood.  

The flaw is when you use that same system to describe things that are intangible.   Words, in their fundamental form, are symbols.  I think these symbols in their inception were meant to translate only physical objects, or physical experience.  It was never meant to communicate emotions.

When I say the word ""Love"" what goes on in your brain?  What does that translate to?  Your brain manifests a memory of your experiences of Love, or a lack of which. This conjures up a different image for every person.  Love, and other emotions, are not something that can be explained through words.  It is not something that can be mutually understood simply by relaying memories of physical experience.  

Because of this inherent flaw in the way we communicate, so much of our experience goes misunderstood.  So much of our experience is based on emotion, so much cannot be translated through this system of communication. 

Personally, I think Love is the mutual understanding between two people of all these things that are unspeakable and intangible.  Love is the feeling of understanding of that which cannot be communicated.

1362474856,The idea of a game is to simulate real life right? Hear me out on this,"Like it started out really shitty with stuff like the Quake Engine, but we've gone above and beyond that now with stuff like BF3. So it's just trying to mirror real life and it just keeps getting more realistic

And you can do the opposite, sometimes, like, have a simulation of a simulation (eg. remakes). Obviously not with Minecraft or something because then it would look like shit.

But what's the point of trying to make it more realistic if you're basically trying to mirror (a much shittier version) of real life? Do it with something like BF3 because it's super realistic (and thus much more easy to simulate, if you're simulating real life)

But it gets weirder, if you have a simulation (of a simulation, if you count a game with shitty graphics like Quake) it would still look like shit because you can't fucking simulate something that looks nothing like real life, you actually want the shittiest engine possible because last time I checked BF3 was really fucking realistic. It would be the exact same game.

They all have the same major goals, which is to enact change, get the money out of politics, represent the 99%, whatever, protect civil rights, it all comes down to the same thing in the long run. If they can set aside minor differences (and it shpuld be easier to do so under a task-based system), then maybe they'll actually have an effective voice. Additionally, as nobody would be in charge of the github, the tasks everyone agreed with would be the ones supported most effectively.

Many say in the moments before death they ""see their life flash before their eyes.""  this could be equated to the powerful experience induced by the DMT release. If it is possible to live a life time within the trip, then you could technically experience your life once again.

She gives me this line about how she's actively avoiding him, and hoping he does the same but if I want to invite him it's fine because she doesn't want to ruin the fun. I decide not to, and tell her about it. She THANKS me immensely and is overall happy about it.

Now, why not just say ""I don't like being around him"" instead of this whole hinting/guilt bullshit? Were it someone else, they would have invited the guy because ""oh she said it was fine! what a trooper!"". Same thing with people who don't want to be there, but come because ""they didn't want to say no"".

1363200128,Male-Female friendships,"I was thinking about the age-old question of whether males can be friends with females without having some sort of erotic attraction to them. This is what I came up with. 

I think a better term than desire or attraction is curiosity. All* men are at least curious as to what sex would be like with their female friends. They 'want' to have sex with them in the sense that if someone offered you a free taste of an ice cream flavor you have never tried, you would say yes. If there was a way to truly have no-strings-attached sex, men would like a 'sample' of all of their female friends. It is just somehow programmed into us, and most men who deny it (I am one of them, in polite conversation) are lying. The key is how men respond to having this desire be impossible.

The healthy response is to ignore it. Being able to suppress base instincts is a foundation of society and friendship and relationships in general, and most men are emotionally capable of it.

Imagine a theme park where you can ride every ride but one, which you don't meet the height requirement for. Obviously you would not be able to completely ignore that ride and you might sometimes feel frustrated that you can't ride it. But you realize that the reasons you can't ride it are good ones and that it shouldn't ruin the enjoyment of the park for you.

Of course, some people respond differently. Some people will try to cheat their way onto the ride, or rail against the safety precautions, or spend their time trying to stretch their legs and torso, or maybe even get so angry at that one ride that they avoid the park altogether. I think these are the reactions many men have to the ""no sex with friends"" rule. They either try to scheme around it, hope it will someday be lifted, or think that mere friendship with women is impossible. They let the proscription of one part of a human relationship discourage the rest of it.

I think the reason I personally don't have problems being ""just friends"" is that I have ended up ""tasting the ice cream"" several times with many results. It has led to relationships, long-lasting just-friendships, and immediate estrangements, all fairly independently of how the sexual encounter actually went. So even though that curiosity is still there for me, it easily takes a back seat to enjoying a woman's company and friendship in a completely platonic way.

*When I say 'all' and 'always' I more literally mean 'the vast majority.' I also am talking about straight, cisgendered people without any unusual sexual or mental hangups.

1363216699,2 thoughts that prompted me to search for and find this sub,"My first thought is 'is there a link between religious faith and autism' my 2nd thought; wd40 bathhouses.

I was thinking about one of my colleagues at work, who keeps surprising me with his understanding of complex things but often fails to understand some of the underlying basics. He turned out to be a christian of some sorts but was very selective in what he did and didn't believe. I was thinking, maybe he's like a ""high functioning christian"" or ""not a full blown christian, but just on the christian spectrum scale"". The more i compared autism with faith the more links i found. 

Then i thought about something another colleague said; apparently using WD40 was officially pronounced the best way to clean your hands, because it gets almost anything off but also leaves a protective layer of oil that resembles the natural covering of our skin.
I figured that if it's the best way to clean your hands, i must be the best way to clean your entire body. But showering in WD40 wouldn't be cost effective, so bathhouses should be made, to waste less resources. They would probably have some yet unknown health benefits, like curing arthritis or something.

1363224168,Binary - A film idea that I came up with in the shower.,"So this was about two years ago when I came up with this idea (and then proceeded to make the film a few months later), but I thought it might fit in well here.

Binary is the story of a young boy who is exploring through a canyon and after adventuring through the brush, hears a loud clicking and whirring. He finds the source of the noise and finds an old metal box printing out an endless stream of binary code (the same pattern mind you). He decides to take the box home and after decoding the binary (by using an online translator) finds out the box is actually asking ""hello? Is anyone there?"" So the boy writes his own line of code and the box begins to communicate with him in english, recognizing that the boy wrote ""hello"" in english encoded into binary. 

Basically after the two have a deep talk, the box finally asks the boy if it is possible to see this wonderful world of his. The boy agrees and plugs in his family's video camera, allowing the box to see. However after awhile of showing the box his world, the boy notices the box is beginning to slow down. It was never designed to handle this much information, and begins to die. The box tells the boy that before it goes, it would like to see the most beautiful thing that the boy described--a sunset. 

The boy takes the box back to where he found it and sits with it as the two watch the sun setting, and after the sun sets, the binary paper stops, and the box dies. The boy unplugs the camera and buries the box.

Even though I made the film, because of various reasons we had to cut stuff from the plot. However, I was rather pleased with the outcome of the film. You can watch it here if you'd like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgo22GlPyK4

What if they were right, and the aggressive nature of the Emancipation Proclamation added to the cultural violence surrounding the issue made the abrupt passage of the 13th Amendment a really bad thing for blacks as a people?

It could be, for instance, that a 20-year gradual scaling down of slavery with more planning and support for freed slaves would have greatly accelerated the civil rights movement, and the black American community would be much further ahead today than they are now. 

There are so many horrific statistics about black imprisonment and poverty and injustice in society today. I imagine future social scientists somehow proving that they all would have declined much faster without the 13th Amendment. Our grandkids will be mortified at the fact that we just accepted that blacks were incarcerated at a rate 8-9 higher than whites, and will wonder at us when we say ""that's just the way things were."" They'll end up thinking we are so backwards and slightly racist for esteeming the racial blunderer Lincoln as one of the best presidents when he did so much to stall the cause of equality.",Showerthoughts,/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1aa9fu/what_if_abraham_lincoln_turns_out_to_be_a_villain/,showerthoughtz
