1360874314,"Spoken language is inherently flawed, as it can never appropriately translate emotion.","Obviously, verbal language in the form of words is just a combination of certain sounds.  Of course this system is easy for communicating physical objects in a quick and efficient way.  When I say the word ""tree"" your brain conjures up the image of a tree.  It is tangible. You reach back for a memory of what you know to be a tangible object.  Language, in this form, is indeed perfect, because when you communicate a physical object with this system, the memory it links back to is universal, and therefore universally understood.  

The flaw is when you use that same system to describe things that are intangible.   Words, in their fundamental form, are symbols.  I think these symbols in their inception were meant to translate only physical objects, or physical experience.  It was never meant to communicate emotions.

When I say the word ""Love"" what goes on in your brain?  What does that translate to?  Your brain manifests a memory of your experiences of Love, or a lack of which. This conjures up a different image for every person.  Love, and other emotions, are not something that can be explained through words.  It is not something that can be mutually understood simply by relaying memories of physical experience.  

Because of this inherent flaw in the way we communicate, so much of our experience goes misunderstood.  So much of our experience is based on emotion, so much cannot be translated through this system of communication. 

Personally, I think Love is the mutual understanding between two people of all these things that are unspeakable and intangible.  Love is the feeling of understanding of that which cannot be communicated.

1362474856,The idea of a game is to simulate real life right? Hear me out on this,"Like it started out really shitty with stuff like the Quake Engine, but we've gone above and beyond that now with stuff like BF3. So it's just trying to mirror real life and it just keeps getting more realistic

And you can do the opposite, sometimes, like, have a simulation of a simulation (eg. remakes). Obviously not with Minecraft or something because then it would look like shit.

But what's the point of trying to make it more realistic if you're basically trying to mirror (a much shittier version) of real life? Do it with something like BF3 because it's super realistic (and thus much more easy to simulate, if you're simulating real life)

But it gets weirder, if you have a simulation (of a simulation, if you count a game with shitty graphics like Quake) it would still look like shit because you can't fucking simulate something that looks nothing like real life, you actually want the shittiest engine possible because last time I checked BF3 was really fucking realistic. It would be the exact same game.

They all have the same major goals, which is to enact change, get the money out of politics, represent the 99%, whatever, protect civil rights, it all comes down to the same thing in the long run. If they can set aside minor differences (and it shpuld be easier to do so under a task-based system), then maybe they'll actually have an effective voice. Additionally, as nobody would be in charge of the github, the tasks everyone agreed with would be the ones supported most effectively.

Many say in the moments before death they ""see their life flash before their eyes.""  this could be equated to the powerful experience induced by the DMT release. If it is possible to live a life time within the trip, then you could technically experience your life once again.

She gives me this line about how she's actively avoiding him, and hoping he does the same but if I want to invite him it's fine because she doesn't want to ruin the fun. I decide not to, and tell her about it. She THANKS me immensely and is overall happy about it.

Now, why not just say ""I don't like being around him"" instead of this whole hinting/guilt bullshit? Were it someone else, they would have invited the guy because ""oh she said it was fine! what a trooper!"". Same thing with people who don't want to be there, but come because ""they didn't want to say no"".

1363200128,Male-Female friendships,"I was thinking about the age-old question of whether males can be friends with females without having some sort of erotic attraction to them. This is what I came up with. 

I think a better term than desire or attraction is curiosity. All* men are at least curious as to what sex would be like with their female friends. They 'want' to have sex with them in the sense that if someone offered you a free taste of an ice cream flavor you have never tried, you would say yes. If there was a way to truly have no-strings-attached sex, men would like a 'sample' of all of their female friends. It is just somehow programmed into us, and most men who deny it (I am one of them, in polite conversation) are lying. The key is how men respond to having this desire be impossible.

The healthy response is to ignore it. Being able to suppress base instincts is a foundation of society and friendship and relationships in general, and most men are emotionally capable of it.

Imagine a theme park where you can ride every ride but one, which you don't meet the height requirement for. Obviously you would not be able to completely ignore that ride and you might sometimes feel frustrated that you can't ride it. But you realize that the reasons you can't ride it are good ones and that it shouldn't ruin the enjoyment of the park for you.

Of course, some people respond differently. Some people will try to cheat their way onto the ride, or rail against the safety precautions, or spend their time trying to stretch their legs and torso, or maybe even get so angry at that one ride that they avoid the park altogether. I think these are the reactions many men have to the ""no sex with friends"" rule. They either try to scheme around it, hope it will someday be lifted, or think that mere friendship with women is impossible. They let the proscription of one part of a human relationship discourage the rest of it.

I think the reason I personally don't have problems being ""just friends"" is that I have ended up ""tasting the ice cream"" several times with many results. It has led to relationships, long-lasting just-friendships, and immediate estrangements, all fairly independently of how the sexual encounter actually went. So even though that curiosity is still there for me, it easily takes a back seat to enjoying a woman's company and friendship in a completely platonic way.

*When I say 'all' and 'always' I more literally mean 'the vast majority.' I also am talking about straight, cisgendered people without any unusual sexual or mental hangups.

1363216699,2 thoughts that prompted me to search for and find this sub,"My first thought is 'is there a link between religious faith and autism' my 2nd thought; wd40 bathhouses.

I was thinking about one of my colleagues at work, who keeps surprising me with his understanding of complex things but often fails to understand some of the underlying basics. He turned out to be a christian of some sorts but was very selective in what he did and didn't believe. I was thinking, maybe he's like a ""high functioning christian"" or ""not a full blown christian, but just on the christian spectrum scale"". The more i compared autism with faith the more links i found. 

Then i thought about something another colleague said; apparently using WD40 was officially pronounced the best way to clean your hands, because it gets almost anything off but also leaves a protective layer of oil that resembles the natural covering of our skin.
I figured that if it's the best way to clean your hands, i must be the best way to clean your entire body. But showering in WD40 wouldn't be cost effective, so bathhouses should be made, to waste less resources. They would probably have some yet unknown health benefits, like curing arthritis or something.

1363224168,Binary - A film idea that I came up with in the shower.,"So this was about two years ago when I came up with this idea (and then proceeded to make the film a few months later), but I thought it might fit in well here.

Binary is the story of a young boy who is exploring through a canyon and after adventuring through the brush, hears a loud clicking and whirring. He finds the source of the noise and finds an old metal box printing out an endless stream of binary code (the same pattern mind you). He decides to take the box home and after decoding the binary (by using an online translator) finds out the box is actually asking ""hello? Is anyone there?"" So the boy writes his own line of code and the box begins to communicate with him in english, recognizing that the boy wrote ""hello"" in english encoded into binary. 

Basically after the two have a deep talk, the box finally asks the boy if it is possible to see this wonderful world of his. The boy agrees and plugs in his family's video camera, allowing the box to see. However after awhile of showing the box his world, the boy notices the box is beginning to slow down. It was never designed to handle this much information, and begins to die. The box tells the boy that before it goes, it would like to see the most beautiful thing that the boy described--a sunset. 

The boy takes the box back to where he found it and sits with it as the two watch the sun setting, and after the sun sets, the binary paper stops, and the box dies. The boy unplugs the camera and buries the box.

Even though I made the film, because of various reasons we had to cut stuff from the plot. However, I was rather pleased with the outcome of the film. You can watch it here if you'd like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgo22GlPyK4

What if they were right, and the aggressive nature of the Emancipation Proclamation added to the cultural violence surrounding the issue made the abrupt passage of the 13th Amendment a really bad thing for blacks as a people?

It could be, for instance, that a 20-year gradual scaling down of slavery with more planning and support for freed slaves would have greatly accelerated the civil rights movement, and the black American community would be much further ahead today than they are now. 

There are so many horrific statistics about black imprisonment and poverty and injustice in society today. I imagine future social scientists somehow proving that they all would have declined much faster without the 13th Amendment. Our grandkids will be mortified at the fact that we just accepted that blacks were incarcerated at a rate 8-9 higher than whites, and will wonder at us when we say ""that's just the way things were."" They'll end up thinking we are so backwards and slightly racist for esteeming the racial blunderer Lincoln as one of the best presidents when he did so much to stall the cause of equality.",Showerthoughts,/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1aa9fu/what_if_abraham_lincoln_turns_out_to_be_a_villain/,showerthoughtz

1580112161,"How to be a perfect lover, human, organism etc.","So if you think about it. If you want to be a perfect partner for your partner, then you would have to be the pokemon ditto.

Sometimes your partner wants her partner to be a patient counsellor. Sometimes your partner wants you to be someone who knows how to kick ass, sometimes your partner wants you to make her laugh, sometimes your partner wants you to be someone who she can brag about in front of her friends.... Etc etc etc.

You can never be perfect. Unless you know how to change yourself physically and mentally.

It's just that human needs and wants keep changing throughout their lives.

So it is impossible to keep someone satisfied.

And this rule applies to more than that.

If you think about it, if you can change yourself mentally and physically, then you will never die.

Because, let's say that the world goes through ice age, then you transform yourself into a creature that can withstand that level of cold. Similarly for heat and water and so on.

Our definition of normal keeps changing with time and if you are not able to adapt, you would find it difficult to fit in.

To gather enough information before you die and then pass it on to your children for them to do the same and so on for eternity? To what end? To what goal? Death is inevitable.

The quest mankind was burdened with since the beginning of evolution.
Woman: So, what now? Why am I here?

Man: I think so.

I think it’s messed up that if people are broke it’s pretty much “fuck ‘em”. We know what happens if it gets too bad: You starve/die etc, however we all inhabit this planet together(not by choice) and everyone has a consciousness and for leaders of the nations/species to treat their own kind like such is messed up and I’m sure it hasn’t gone unnoticed by the universe. I think of the universe as the mother/the reason for our birth. How would she feel if she saw her children treating eachother like this? 
That being said, just as laws and abstract concepts are in effect simply because “They said-so and we know-so” who’s to say that as a planet &amp; from one existential being to another we couldn’t make the world leaders make things right for humanity. We have minds and a consciousness just like them. They eat sleep and shit just as we do. I don’t think we get money from the moon; we’ve created it. What’s so hard about making and distributing money to help every human on the planet and not leave them to wither away? 
People could eat, college wouldn’t be as stressful for the students who are to shape and change the coming era, it’s all around beneficial and wholesome.

The brain uses about 20 watts, not more than a lightbulb. We hallucinate our consciousness reality, you read it all the time.

But the brain doesn't just convert all the information from the senses to an image. That would probably consume much more energy. Instead what's considered important/in focus is generated that way, but the majority is instead coming from our memory.

so, 
im hoping some have heard about the whole thing around 'seeing the light' when you die, linked with the same light you see when you are first born into the world. makes sense, right? 
but then also, i had a completely different thought on the people you meet/have met in the life you that you live in right now. completely ignoring the family you're born into(bc lets b real, theyre not all that great), but have anyone ever thought, that the people that you personally meet/have met in life are people you've met in your previous life? because i mean there had to be some sort of magical/weird connection to this whole 'life' thing. and whoever you're closest to the most(again, not family but friends/acquaintances) are people you've previously been close to. whether that be an actual male or female, or even a pet, or a tree you've climbed, or bird you've fed in a park, or a wasp that you killed? i mean, i know it sounds completely crazy, but that's exactly what life and the universe is. and its fckin magical too. 
i don't believe in any god, but i do believe that we don't just have one life. that would be a complete waste. there's way more to this whole thing.
what are your crazy thoughts on life as a whole? on the universe? what our actual, genuine mission and reason is?

God/the universe wanted to have different experiences so “he” died to himself and became you and I so that “he” can experience something different.

We are all the universe experiencing itself, experiencing its own creation through different perspectives. But here’s where it gets crazy!!

What you think and feel , you become and experience. There is no difference between someone who is wealthy or poor, sick or healthy. It’s the same conscious awareness of being just arranged differently. Like how water takes on different forms (solid, liquid, gas) but in the end it’s still water. 

Your true self concept is your destiny. If you think of yourself as ugly and you truly believe it then that experience will be created for you. You are ugly. But it doesn’t have to be this way. You can feel that you are the most beautiful person ever and if you persist in that belief, that assumption, it will harden into fact and you will experience that in your reality. This goes for everything, health, wealth, intelligence, etc. It’s how all the successful people in the world have created their success and in the same way how all the miserable people in the world created their suffering.

Heres an experiment to test it for yourself !

Get yourself in a comfortable position. A chair or in bed. Close your eyes. Relax every muscle and fiber of your being. There should be no tension in your body. Say to yourself “I am relaxed” over and over again for a few moments or minutes until you truly feel relaxed. Now imagine that right now you are holding a tennis ball 🎾! 

Do this repeatedly over and over. Give it all the feelings of reality. Imagine that right now you are holding a tennis ball. Convince yourself deeply that you are ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW holding a tennis ball. Keep feeling this over and over again for a few minutes until it feels completely real to you and no different from reality. 

If you’re doing this experiment before bed you can fall asleep after it feels real or if not you can slowly rise and wake back to your normal self and continue on with your day. 

Now forget about that experience. Drop it. If done correctly you will be lead across a bridge of events in your everyday life that will make you hold a tennis ball. It will feel so natural to you that you forget you created this experience.

It’s okay, you can say to yourself “no way, i’m NOT going to hold a tennis ball” but if you imagined correctly with deep conviction then it can be no other way and soon you will find yourself holding a tennis ball. Maybe it will be tomorrow or next week but you will be lead across a bridge of events that make you hold a tennis ball. 

Let me know if it works for you and if it does great !! Now you found your power and you can create anything you want in life!! Wealth, relationships, etc!!",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/er2k3b/we_are_god_and_we_create_all_the_events_we/,fuckin-fajita

1579393227,want to know if my derealization/depersonalization experience is relatable.,"This is not my first dr/dp experience but I thought I’d share it because of the important realizations I think I made. 

Last night I was just in my kitchen, watching some music video on my laptop high as fuck. First the music video started to look very dumb and cringe, like the costume the singer had on, the way he was singing, the instruments that were playing in the background, I started to judge him for no reason even though when I’m sober I love this guys music and his videos. I stop the video because the secondhand embarrassment for some reason was too much to handle...So then I look up from my computer and kind of zone out in my kitchen for a hot minute. That’s when the vibe of everything around me started to morph into this like, super fucking empty and pathetic ambience. My kitchen looked ugly as hell and all the appliances on the counter started to look foreign to me. I felt like I could see all the matter in my kitchen as it existed in time and space....that filter of every day familiarity and human perception was just wiped away from my eyes. We exist in a 3D world and we perceive things in 2D, but I felt like I was viewing my kitchen from alien eyes in 3D, like I could see all the objects laying around in this grid of time and space. Like I was not from this earth, viewing this kitchen like I’d never seen a regular American kitchen before. Mad derealization vibes. 

Granted, the music I was listening to didn’t really help with the experience either lol. I really like the song Verdigris by Gus Dapperton, but in that moment the song felt so alien and creepy to me, like I was watching my pathetic life from a 3rd person perspective and the music was just the sad/empty background track to my pointless existence. And my life isn’t even pathetic which is what pissed me off the most. I’m a fucking generally happy college student with no real problems or issues in my life right now and nothing to really complain about but in that moment my life felt like one big joke. I eventually came to a particularly depressing realization while in this altered state of mind, which is what pulled my last straw that night. 

The weed had made my experience of the present moment SO intense, that I finally, TRULY realized what it meant to live life in this medium of time as a human being. I realized that all I will ever really HAVE in my life is the present moment. I know that seems pretty obvious at face value, but I experienced this at a level of understanding way beyond how I understood this while sober. At any given present moment, on average, most people are in a neutral state of emotion. The every day mundane things we do we do in a neutral emotional state. Obviously there are moments where you feel joy, or you feel sorrow, but these moments are just sprinkled in to your time line. The rest of the large gaps left in your time line are just filled with this detached, neutral, autopilot type emotion. 

No matter what negative or positive spikes in emotion you experience throughout your day they are fleeting, and you always come back to this neutral state of just being/existing, and that perpetual state of nothingness is all you will ever really HAVE in your life.

You will have happy moments and sad moments, but in the end your life is literally just you, existing in discrete moments that are strung together into this continuum we call “life”. But nothing will ever truly exist beyond the current moment, your soul will kind of just trapped in this dimension of perception until you die. that made me feel so goddamn scared, pathetic, sad, trapped, pointless, and a whole lot of uneasiness. My insides started feeling so uncomfortable, like this emotion invoked a physical response...

 it was almost like every single cell in my body, for the first, time understood that it’s existence was pointless. 

I’ve never ever felt such a profound understanding of life, time, and the phenomenon of just being. I feel like we are not supposed to be shown this alternate reality as human, but weed kind of allows you to access it in a way that your sober mind just can’t. 

I don’t really want to hear anyone tell me to take a break from weed, because I’m already doing that and that wasn’t the point of this post. I just want to know if people can relate to these profound realizations, and how to gain a sense of purpose back after having said realizations.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/eqoyi1/want_to_know_if_my_derealizationdepersonalization/,yardiknowwtfgoinon

1579302406,Karma doesn't give a fuck about tImE. [WARNING] Simulation Inside.,"I'm on my phone, sorry. 

Karmic justice doesn't always come AFTER the action tied to it. You could've experienced its givings in your past before the action was ever committed. Or it could also come post action. Sometimes it's instant as we all know very well.

Am I saying your future asshole self has the ability to totally fuck up your day? Yep, pretty much. 

If reincarnation is a thing then it would explain some exceptions(a child with cancer, the koala roast in Australia, etc). Your past/future score affects the present self. Of course we can't confirm OR deny the possibility of reincarnation. We haven't successfully mapped consciousness yet. And also, we can only observe time linearly. 

Hinduism and Buddhism gave us the concept of Karma albeit a really dumbed down version of it. Also, religious texts have been modified and translated so many times that their originality will perpetually remain unverified. So there's no guide book to save you. 

But there are accounts of some 'enlightened' rishis and monks who abruptly decide to leave everyone and everything behind to live out the remainder of their lives in solitary meditation. They feel no compulsion to share what they learnt or desire to live in their society/community. So they leave.

I have a tHeOrY: 

Note: Language is insufficient to explain some metaphysical theories so bear with me. Like how sometimes words are insufficient to explain real experiences. 


We, the 'players' are being simulated and karma is a quantum metric. There's no good or bad karma. It's just a score that follows your consciousness(devoid of past memory) into the next player. Let's call this Qrma. Your qrma determines the justice bearing events of your life but it is malleable during. Along with every action/interaction with other players, comes a change in qrma and this is inevitable. The simulation simply needs givers and takers. If no one gives or takes then that means there's no more action or interaction among the specimen left to observe and the simulation fails. So qrma is also a failsafe that exists to guarantee action. It shapes you, follows you and affects you every day. If at the end of your player life - your qrma score exists, that's your passport to your next life. If it doesn't, your consciousness bears no more value and it's discarded*. 

At 'enlightenment' the player realized that their consciousness is a slave to the simulation and the only way to escape it is to balance out qrma. This impossible task is only possible if the consciousness had help from a previous player. Hence the reason for abandoning everything and ceasing interaction with other players(no more change in karma). And any further karmic justice dished out won't have the power to elicit a reaction to/with/from another player. Therein lies the irony in enlightenment when they realize their consciousness is absolutely powerless to change the outcome of the endless recycle. All they can do is meditate their hopes to whichever dumb fuck player wins their consciousness next. 

There are obviously many constraints in this model but I have no more time today to go over the rest. (Example: how do other lifeform fit into the model, how future players influence your current one). There's one more thing - I say 'your', 'their' consciousness. It may very well be the same consciousness program just with different qrma scores attached. 

Anyhoo, 
We all like a good experience so what can you do today to asshole-proof your future? Keep your intentions clean for one is the seed of every action.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/eq84he/karma_doesnt_give_a_fuck_about_time_warning/,unbridler

Understanding things at a 45° angle to reality allows hidden things to be seen, but hides the obvious at times. And that same 45° angle causes thoughts to be more affected by the gravity of the thought that follows them, and to be thrown far away, rather than establishing a stable orbit. Not, of course, in a literal sense of any of those words. My point is, that the abstract world is a much more detailed and vivid world, more attractive to us than the mundaine.

The road goes upwards towards the light, but the laden traveler may never reach the end of it. Kinda like mario on the staircase when he doesnt have enough stars... Man approaches an unattainable truth through succession of errors. Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad, but sober. Not to make us sorry, but wise. You'll be required to do wrong no matter where you go. This is the basic condition of life. You are required to violate your own identity, the ""soul"" of who you are. Every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, and the metamorphosis of who you are, and creation itself. This is the grand ""spell"" at work. The ""spell"" that feeds on all life within this 3rd dimensional universe. The gravest error a thinking person can make, is to believe that one particular version of history is absolute fact. History is recorded by a series of observers, none whom are impartial. Is change itself that is continual, and inevitable. It is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made without taking into account the world as it is, and the world as it will be... 
    The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than our society gathers wisdom. Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than those who went before them, and wiser than then the generation that comes after. Humanity is the unnatural animal, the rebel creature of nature, and more and more do we turn ourselves against the harsh and rightful hand of mother nature, the hand that reared us to who we are today. It doesn't matter what we do as long as we have changed something from the way it was before we touched it, into something thats like us after we have taken our hands away. 
     The very concept of objective truth is fading fast from this world, as lies pass unto history. Solitude and isolation are painful things, and beyond human endurance.

1578724410,"If nothing happens after you die, what matters while your alive?","So I know the title sounds kinda morbid but hear me out. I'm 17 and from Ohio. The first time I smoked I was a little kid but I didn't really start smoking consistently until October 2018. In the last year I've had a whole bunch of different realizations and have definitely learned to judge a little less and love a little more.

In the last year a lot of different things hit me and the first one of which was the idea that ""the universe is so big nothing in it matters."" I think this hits every teenager kinda hard but I'm usually pretty good at dealing with regular life stuff like that so when I didn't get over it right away I kinda dug into that thought and  with that came the idea that I didn't have any conscious memories from before I was born so what's to prove to me I'll have conscious memories after I die?

The second thing that hit me was how much I missed simpler times. When I was little I went to the same school district for 6 years (so I did a lot of growing up with those kids and just a few were like family.) until I was 11 and moved across town. I did fine personally but this totally flipped my life upsidedown, all my friends were across town and I was too young to get to them by myself and I don't wanna be that guy but I had a lot of trouble making friends at my new school too. I felt really alone all the sudden which was very unusual for me. I just remembered how when I was a happy little kid my biggest problem was figuring out which house everyone was at or are we going to the the old factory behind the park today. Those were some of the happiest days of my life and I couldn't think of a time when I had really been that happy since I was around 10. After a long time of thinking I came up with what I call a philosophy that fixed both those problems a some more.


 When you die, if nothing happens then you genuinely don't take anything with you. You just leave stuff behind. So if all your doing is leaving stuff behind what is going to effect the people still here? One, how you made them feel. Two, the memories you leave them with. Simply put the philosophy goes like this...

"" I think the only thing that really matters in this life is the memories and love that we leave behind and it's extremely important we tell those people we love them and make the absolute best memories we can for everybody in our lives and beyond those two things nothing else really matters because well nothing else will change anything once I'm dead.""
 
 I've really done my best to live by the idea of ""make the best memories you can for everyone around you and tell everyone you love, you love them as much as possible because tomorrow is never promised."" 

Honestly it's helped a lot because I know if I die tomorrow the people I love won't question whether or not I loved them because I've told them plenty of times and I'll tell them plenty more, and I did my best to make the best memories for everyone to look back happy on once I'm gone. I don't really mind dying I guess I'll just try to make the best of life while I can.

1578710325,Change and People's Opinion - What to do when people oppose your inevitable change,"This post can be seen in two ways. First, maybe people don't like it when they have to change their opinion of you because of our drive to form societies and communal bonds for protection. Within these groups, we like to keep rules and standards of living to ensure that everyone is invested in the survival of the group. This creates a sense of togetherness where we lose the self in the sacrifice of group cooperation and cohesion. The group demands that people behave in specific ways so they can make complex judgments about a person they don't know, based on the rules. This way, nothing is unexpected, and you can at least assume what the person thinks or does. If you have a cohesive group, you can plan for survival and how to treat others from outside the group, who might pose a threat to the established order. In all these social dynamics, you changing your character might upset the group and trigger defense mechanisms from our older, survival-focused brains. Standards of living were originally created to improve the survival possibility of a group.

This could be a reason for people not liking you to change, or they could be hiding more sinister motivations of competition, control, or power, which, in turn, unearth emotions of jealousy and envy, even hatred. People will often like you for what you can offer them, and when you no longer offer them anything similar to what you were, they cut you off, or get resentful. They want you to be successful, just enough to maintain standing in the group so they can benefit from you, but once you get more successful than them, they start to feel insecure and may have their egos challenged. They have put you in a box, a box of behaviors and expectations, that you must abide by. You have become the object, and they have become the subject, as they define what you Being should be. Their definition is based on their assumptions and observations of you, and they have categorized you into whatever description they may. In doing this, they have figured you out and determined how to treat you. When you start bettering yourself, and they don't, it highlights their short-comings and challenges their opinion. From the start, this was a toxic relationship where your growth was limited by other people's conclusions. They may have even made negative remarks, laughed at your plans, or outright told you that you don't have what it takes to succeed. Those people stagnated and stayed in the same place for years, without any growth. Don't confuse genuine criticism for this type of behavior. Some criticism is necessary, but you can tell for sure the difference between someone trying to hold you back against genuinely good advice.

To counter this, you must cut these people off. If they have an opinion of you that gets shattered by you changing for the better, and they're mad about it, cut them off. Those people were never your friends in the first place. They were simply ''just there,'' and you two depended on each other for some time, so you acted civil enough and tolerated each other, but you were never friends. When you started to move up the metaphorical ladder to greater things, they tried to hold you back, because they had attached themselves to you further down, when you were nobody. They don't want you to leave. They want you to wallow in self-pity and stay with them. You must know, and know this well, they are meant to be down there. They are meant to be at the bottom. That's their place – the lowly existence of the lazy, self-loathing, sad dropkicks of society. There is a place for everyone, and if you have a drive to change, for the better, you are not meant to be a the bottom. If you resist this drive, the sense of change that comes from deep within you, you will suffer the most painful consequences, all self-inflicted. Depression and self-loathing will take the place of happiness and accomplishment that you would have felt if you changed for the good. You will embody nihilism as you self-sabotage and destroy any meaning in your life. You must change, there is no other way, and even if it's painful, the alternative is worse. Resist your call, and you will unknowingly destroy yourself from the inside out. One of the speed bumps along the way will be people's response to you - the opinions they form. Your old friends may not like the changes you've made; again, they must be authentic changes for the better; I can't stress that enough. These people's opinions will slow you down, but you must break through them, and cut those friends off. On the contrary, you will have friends who encourage you. Keep these friends. They are the ones you need to spend time with. They will not drain your energy. They will show you that there are new possibilities. They will be your guide. After spending more time with them, you'll never want to go back to the old friends who pulled you down.

Either way, understand that people's opinions of you, say more about themselves than they do about you. Let those people remain unconscious as you conquer the potential you were destined for. There are forces within the body that we consciously cannot control, and when a drive emerges from deep within, go with it, just make sure that it is authentic.

1578697713,Existence from a programmer’s perspective,"It’s said that the universe runs on math.

‪If the universe runs on math, then we are the programs that have become conscious. Once we became conscious, we started building civilization. A civilization that now has the average westerner living with standards that would make medieval kings and queens jealous. Fresh strawberries for tonight’s dessert, in the winter? Watch the work of an ensemble of thousands of artists and craftsmen, and be able to decide on genre five minutes before? Have a slab in your hand that gives you access to knowledge pretty much all of humanity’s collective knowledge with a few taps? No regent, however powerful, had that. 

We may not have the same living standards as the royalty of yore, but the fortunate of us have roof over our heads and food on our plate on a regular basis. We have regained what our ancestors lost once they founded civilization: time for our minds to explore our world. There was no paid vacation in the 15th century, there was no need for vacation when we were hunter-gatherers. Here, I’m not romanticizing that lifestyle, it’s simply that they would not understand the concept of “work” and hence not understand “vacation” either. I’m also not saying that minds haven’t explored their world before, but in order for exploration to expand the world of many and not just the one, the fruits of that exploration must be shared. The fact that you’re reading this means that you have the means to share your exploration with not just your tribe, not just your village or town, or even the kingdom. You can share it with a large portion of the whole world. Which for all we know is every conscious being in our galaxy (though it may not be what we believe).

We live in the best of times, we live in the worst of times. Our known universe has never been as big. To our knowledge, not our belief - it’s important to understand the difference without judging one as lesser than the other. In the end, they really are the same thing, although the way there is different through each, and in a complex world such as ours, either alone will lead you astray more often than not. 

Belief is a feeling that can be more powerful than knowledge in some contexts, but they need each other. You cannot build a civilization on knowledge alone. In order for people to contribute to a better tomorrow they need to believe in the future. That belief is built into us through our DNA: we procreate, and want our children to do at least as well as we have. 

Belief is the most basic of our sapient programming. It is programmed into us by our society, our community, our family and friends. It is programmed by our own wants and desires. The desire to be loved. Seen. Validated. Perhaps a mind can exist without the notion of “other”, but that is something we can not currently experience, because our DNA (which sets limits on our minds) has evolved sapience in a social context.

Have you ever doubted that you really have free will? I have. I understand many of the philosophical arguments against free will, and they seduced me for a while, give or take five years. I have landed in the firm belief that we have free will. That free will means “the ability to program your mind in whichever way you see fit”. What we see as restraints, is simply the stalk of a flower that has yet to bloom fully. 

Knowledge can correct our belief when our belief is wrong. That is painful, the deeper held the erroneous belief is, the more painful it is to correct it. Sometimes that means breaking with our community, because communities are based on beliefs. Simply ask yourself: can you ever really know that someone loves you? There is no way you can prove it, you can simply tell me that you know it because you believe them. Love is where belief and knowledge become the same again. 

Emotions are not only how we experience the universe, they are also how we program our mind. Belief is as much a feeling as it is a state of mind.  You simply have to learn to recognize it. 

You have likely been programmed to view emotions as less than rationale. The truth is that rationale is nothing without emotions (people whose emotional center is damaged often have problems making simple choices) and together they make powerful tools to program your own mind. If you’re wondering in which direction you should go, look to your compass: your emotions. Go towards love, stray away from fear. Expand your “I” to include as many others as you can, as often as you can. It can be one other person or humanity as a whole (although our civilization is so complex that the latter becomes very hard, so don’t blame yourself for failing). Every time you do a kindness, whether it is seen or goes seemingly unnoticed, you program your own mind in ways we do not yet understand.  

You are the conscious program, created to solve an equation you cannot fathom. But if you are kind and follow your heart, you can be sure that you’re doing your part. (To be fair, those that are unkind also play their part, but it is a sad one: they are the darkness in which your light can shine)",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/emyvbf/existence_from_a_programmers_perspective/,kazarnowicz

1578656996,IS this real philosophy or am I just super high," 

I just got really high for the first time in a long time, and tried to write some philosophy. Does any of this actually make any sense, or is it just super lofty pseudo high-time wannabe infinitely pretentious shizzle. Here it is:

""

It is important to consider evolution when determining upon epistemological origins regarding the human capacity for objective truth. The relationship between human perception and reality from an evolutionary standpoint is necessarily a relationship between a behavioural response and the provisional elements of reality insofar as is immediately relevant to the subject. In other words, the elements of the environment – more specifically the subset of the environment pertaining to the elements of the immediate reality of the subject – that contribute to the more “successful” existence (evolutionarily speaking) of the subject is the determining cause, and nature, of perception. Thus, the limits of human capacity for understanding objective reality must account for being limited to perceiving that which has been of more relative necessity. Hence the entirety of a local objective reality could, theoretically speaking, be entirely perceivable by an ultimately *infinitely* evolved being within the confines of an accessible reality: as within the parameters of an infinite evolution all of objective reality will have revealed herself via the provision of all necessary heuristics. On such grounds, I argue that while an existentialist perspective on the nature of human truth provides a valuable insight into the “doomed to be within itself” nature of living perception (i.e. the limits of accessible human truth), it is important to note that claiming *some* objective truth – if not the whole truth – is nevertheless a statement about that which reality provides – and hence *is*.

I should clarify with a distinction between *a* truth’s and *the* truth. If you have an infinite “*a”* truths (truths that are not directly representative of reality and yet anchor to *a* truth about reality that provides heuristic provision) you will own the *set* of truths that necessarily – by nature of being infinite – contain all of *the* truth. *The* truth being the entire, real, objective reality.

Such a view can be applied to the arts, and what they represent. To use music as an example, all of that which is musical (in a structural sense) is contained within the relationships between the frequencies of the notes being played. Hence, music is presenting to the subject access mathematical truths (specifically, that pertaining to ratio’s) from within the song that the subject can perceive and understand. While these relationships, and sets of relationships (relationships at a specific point in time, and the entirety of all permutations of relationships between all the notes within the given “frame” (which is seemingly *infinite*, but is in actual fact only *one* form of the many infinites). While these truths do not directly represent the mathematical truth of reality, these truths do represent *something* of reality, which when aggregated together over an infinite time course eventually represent *the* mathematical truth of reality (in an admittedly rather inefficient way).

The above paragraph regarding this applied view to musical structure (i.e. musical truth) can of course be applied to visual structure (optic – as opposed to auditory – art).

1578636635,How should the human race be structured?,"Currently rolling off of some brownies right now so bear with me lol.

I think it is strange how in some fictional universes there are sentient species (think of the mandolorians from star wars) with populations that number in the millions, not billions. One thing i have noticed about these species is that they tend to be incredibly strong and usually very advanced. It kind of reminds me of the spartans.

What if human civilization looked like this? What if instead of having 7.5 billion humans, there was only around (and didnt exceed) 10 million people? Its a question ive been asking myself alot. It would certainly change society in a multitude of ways. There are pros and cons that i theorize we would see from a society like this

Pros: greater resource to people ratio, less people means less impact on environment, energy production is easier and cleaner, education may even become better which will push humanity into the future faster, and more

Cons: manpower becomes the most valuable commodity (less people, less work getting done), less genetic diversity, higher chance of all of humanity dying in one fell swoop, and more

1578321819,What if there were a Netflix Documentary for every saint that's ever been martyred?,"Okay so I know this is Reddit where like 98% of users are atheists and/or scoff at the idea of the existence of God but I'm stoned af and I gotta get this off my chest. So please bear with me and be respectful, this is just how my mind is formulating thoughts right now. 

So I'm watching the Kalief Browder docuseries on Netflix. If you don't know who Kalief Browder was, long story short he was a 16 year old kid that was wrongly accused of stealing a backpack from someone in Bronx NY. He was arrested and because he couldn't post bail, was sent to Riker's Island until his trial was heard. His trial ended up taking three years to be heard where he spent that whole time on Riker's, two of those years spent in solitary confinement. 

The docuseries ends up going through the entire snowball affect of how he ended up getting sent there, the loopholes in the court system that kept him there for so long, the environment that is Riker's Island, the effects of solitary confinement on the human brain, the whole nine yards. It's an incredibly powerful documentary, outlining the severe problems with the justice system and correctional facilities that ""rehabilitate"" ""criminals"". 

Anyway, so I'm watching this documentary, and they were able to interview Kalief after he was finally released when the charges on him were dropped. So I'm listening to this kid talk about his experience, and in almost every shot where he's talking he repeats over and over something along the lines of ""they kept offering me a plea deal but I was never going to admit to doing something that I didn't do"". 

The whole time I'm watching this, never once did I ever think that Kalief was lying about stealing the backpack. I don't think anyone watching this and listening to Kalief could possibly make the case that Kalief was lying about being innocent. I mean, I don't think any guilty individual would dig their heals in regarding their innocence if that person knew he was in fact guilty. No one would go to that length to endure the torture that Kalief endured for three years. There's just no way. 

So then I got this highdea. 

Shortly after the time of Jesus's death, all of his apostles (except John), and thousands of devout Christians over the last 2000 years were martyred for spreading the news about Jesus, His works, teachings, and miracles, and most importantly His claim and confirmation to be the living God.

Now when I say martyred, I mean some of these individuals who eventually became saints due to their devotion to Christ, were tortured. Tortured to the point that would be comparable to that of Kalief Browder. These saints who were martyred in the name of Jesus did so because their faith was greater than any punishment that was inflicted upon them. 

And then I think about today, how so many people who deny Jesus will claim that those were died in His name were lying or mentally ill or bamboozled by Jesus, so much so that they were willing to enture torturous deaths at the hands of those who denied His resurrection. 

Aside from all scripture, philosophy, prophecies, and historical evidence of Jesus, the fact that so many people who not denounce Christ as Lord is almost proof enough that Jesus really did and was what the Christian faith teaches he did and was. In fact, in our court system, there is something called a dying declaration which is defined as ""a testimony that would normally be barred as hearsay but may in common law nonetheless be admitted as evidence in criminal law trials because it constituted the last words of a dying person."" So for all the martyrs in the name of Jesus, all of their dying declarations would be admissible in a trail. 

To say all these people were mistaken about Jesus being God would be analogous to saying Kalief Browder really did steal that person's backpack. It just doesn't add up at all.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/ekv07b/what_if_there_were_a_netflix_documentary_for/,pm_schedule

1578188609,A long-exposure photo is the best way to see a piece of our 4-dimensional self in our 3-dimensional life,"To get this, you kinda have to get the story of Flatland. Carl Sagan does a nice explanation of it.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wv0vxVRGMY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wv0vxVRGMY)

So what would it look like if we went from 3 to 4 and to 5? And how would we see the 4th?

If we were able to zoom out (or up or whatever) into the 5th dimension, and if we were able to extract our 4-dimensional self out of the whatever-D universe so that we could see it by itself, we would see that our 4D self looks like a big, long, tubular, human-shaped worm. It tapers on either end. Let's say we were able to see it all in one frame, from end to end, on the left was when you were born, and it tapers upward into your child self, then your adult self, then it tapers downward into your senior self, then into your dead self, and away into nothing. The length of the worm = time. Imagine taking a picture of yourself at every second, or even nanosecond, of your life and placing them on top of each other. Every mannerism, every movement, every bit of growth, gain, loss, damage, etc to you as you lived your life is like a flip book of you on a higher dimension.

Remember the long-exposure pictures of the 1800s or even some long exposure photos of today? That's a picture of your 4-dimensional self over the course of several ""frames"" worth of your existence - the long exposure captures a piece of all of those ""frames.""

Now you might say, ""you're describing a movie."" Not really. A movie is just flipping through the 4D flip book worm thing of you. The long exposure photo takes all of those frames and mashes them down into a 3D composite version. Oh! Like the clear cross-section pages of the human being in those old encyclopedias!

I wonder if a person would look different if they took an instant picture of themselves in a certain position versus a long exposure picture of themselves in that position. Would there be more detail?

I guess there's two ways to look at this then. Is the worm of ourselves already complete and we're just living our way through it (what's that, determinism?), or is the worm being born and created as we live, leaving behind a trail that would resemble something like a human-shaped black-snake firework thing?

1577997718,The world as Self,"Imagine being the only thing in existence, just a dot in a vast void. You look all around you and you see nothing. How can you tell what is you and what is not you? It is impossible to do so without anything else being there. There is no way to define anything other than your own awareness of being there. So everything in that moment can easily be described as ""you"".

Now, imagine the same scenario but in the world, you're living in now. You look around you and you see things, that is obviously not a part of ""you"" because you have a body. It is easy to define what is you and what is not you. So everything in that moment is separated.

These are just two thought experiments I have, and I'm just interested in what I can do with them. The idea I'm attempting to explain is from many cultures around the world. These ideas are brought on by self-reflection and meditation. The word ""sunyata"" in Sanskrit means emptiness or voidness. Which, it is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditative state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience. There is another term called ""Maya"" which means ""deceit"". Mayans and Buddhists claim that the world is Maya or an illusion.

I believe that during intense meditative states, one is able to achieve a higher state of consciousness. During these higher states of self-awareness, the mind is able to perceive a higher order of thoughts. If the entire world is you, and you are able to tap into this state with mediation or discipline.

1577727906,Perspective,"Aight my dudes. I am not high right now, but I am tripping balls, probably due to post fever serotonin imbalance. But perspective is tripping me out. For example:

I am my zero point for perspective. This would seem to be true for every being which has perspective. The zero point is always the viewer. I.E. to myself, I am absolutely average in size, and in intelligence. However, I am both intelligent to infinity -1, and stupid to infinity -1. Same for size. Because the viewer will always have themselves as the zero point, making me, to them, a sliding scale. By which I mean, someone much more intelligent them me would view me as quite stupid. Someone of a theoretical race an order of magnitude more intelligent than humans would view me as infinity -1 stupid. For perspective. I am about 6 feet tall. When I see someone 7 feet tall, it is a very strange feeling. That is because I am the zero point, and I am at the high range of the heights observed. When I see someone 5 feet tall, the difference is equal, and yet I do not notice the difference as more than a passing impression. This is because I am used to seeing people that are five feet tall on a regular basis. Therefore they have been added as an addendum to my natural zero point of perspective, whereas someone four feet tall, or seven feet tall, will make a marked impression as being significantly outside the zero point and recognised periphery. I think what I am am trying to say is that every person uses themselves as the point from which everything else is judged for it's value. And that value can seem absolute to the viewer, whereas it is actually quite relative. For example, speaking to someone only slightly more intelligent than yourself, you will feel like a moron. Speaking to someone only slightly less intelligent than yourself you will feel as if you are on even footing. Speaking to someone significantly less intelligent than yourself you will feel like a genius. The truth is, in all three cases, on a relative scale, you are both morons, and, simultaneously, both geniuses. The zero point of the viewer, and the accustomed periphery, will both affect your perception, causing this phenomena. 

There was more, but I forgot it. Forgive me for my inane rambling, but it seems really big at the moment, and does put the ego in perspective. For me, at least. At this time.

1577699275,Defining humor (aka comedy) with Newton's calculus.,"The humor of humors, which is henstepl's:

* Beautifully, it is Newton's first derivative of perception with respect to time, where ""perception"" is that which occurs in the brain or to the mind.
* Formulaically, it is d(perception)/d(time).

The most classical ruination of a joke is to explain it to him. This is because to explain it causes him to perceive the funny at a rate of time not exceeding the sentence time in which the rest of the joke was presented.

If instead you let him get it by himself, he perceives the funny at a rate of time exceeding sentence time, and so it's humorous. And he likes it, so it's comedic.

Ok. What the actual hell are we doing? Does anyone have a fucking clue? Or perhaps a goddamn instruction manual? How the fuck do people live? Why the fuck do people want to live? I just don’t understand. Everyone dies and you either make enough friends and family to grieve for you when you’re gone, or you don’t and you don’t leave any impact on the world at all, ever, for your entire life, (except maybe in a random subreddit filled with stoners). Nothing we do makes sense. Society fucking sucks. “ “ “All men need to be manly man men man man men. Don’t cry. Have muskles. Women are objects but they get angry when you treat them like objects so treat them like people until you’ve gained enough brownie points to treat them like objects. Women must not be bitches. Women can’t have opinions and they can’t get angry about anything or else they look like a bitch. Women should also hate each other so they can’t gain up on the men and if they do start to gain up, the patriarchy that doesn’t exist will take them the fuck out and they’ll be married with seventeen children in no time. Gays are spawns of Satan and shouldn’t be treated like humans. Love is a construct but let’s pretend it’s not. Every political party is shit except for mine. My political party can do no wrong...””””and blah blah blah. I fucking hate all people everywhere, but whoopdiedoo! Looks like humanity won the goddamn existence lottery. Poor dinosaurs were here first and according to all known historical records, their society didn’t collapse due to war, famine, pollution, or pure unadulterated hatred. No, they just had God chuck a full ass meteor at them for no goddamn reason and bam! Humanity was a thing that started. Like, why? Why do we have to exist? Why does the universe have to exist? Why do humans have to have crappy thoughts about existence like, “is it real???” Or “iS It aLL a siMULatiOn??????” Like, fuck off. If this was a simulation then imma bout to straight up murder whoever put me here because it’s not fucking fun. Honestly, the dinosaurs deserved better. Why are things so complicated? “You want help with life? Religion, relationships, holidays, dieting, therapy, meds. All these things will help you erase the terrifying feeling of total, utter, loneliness and insignificance in a vast and immeasurable universe!” (Therapy and meds help from what I’ve heard. Don’t knock it till you try it I guess.) Why are there so many goddamn commercials? Why is art a thing that’s judged by everyone even though everyone agrees that art is a thing that is subjective? Why are there fucking 14 year olds on the internet? Why can’t we just blow up all the oil factories and let natural selection do it’s thing? I’d be happy as a dead person due to natural selection. Honestly, I probably should’ve died years ago. Even if this was a simulation, I’m sure I would’ve used up all my lives by now. When is WWIII going to start? I feel like war is just a thing humans do because we’re bored and death is unforgivable and so we’ve decided that constantly killing each other is a good reason to keep on killing each other. Why is it that I don’t see any other species on this whole goddamn space orb struggling with their sense of identity and existence? Maybe if the trees had mouths they could tell us all the secrets of life since their old and never move like Buddha. What I’m trying to say is that humanity sucks so fuck all of you.

Especially in the last 2 years. Manipulation is being used in a new way, on a whole new level. This is not new as in we dont know it, we've had this wisdom forever, but we know what come of it. Haven't we learned a god damn thing? CLEARLY human beings are miserable. Even when you literally have EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKIN. THING. YA ASS STILL IS NOT HAPPY. Status is no longer about how much money you have. That is NOT status. It was a good idea, we tried it, and we tried it pretty heavily.. enough to conclude that NOPE, happiness cant be bought. Yet, we wake up tomorrow and we live to make something happen that is not natural. It is not what god intended. 
Happiness can be found by doing whatever is needed in the moment. Whatever it is that is pulling you, makes you smile, makes you feel good, whatever that is GO DO IT. I know you know what feeling I'm talking about. 

We are all told that if there was no government it would be all hell and chaos. I refuse to believe that. I think a lot of people are scared and when we are scared, we act out of survival instincts. I see a lot of fear agendas being pushed and whether its conscious or subconscious, fear has entered your psyche in some form or another. Perhaps this is where emotions have been derived from. Duality. When the 'God' (divine, quark, energy, wave particle) switchboard got turned on it saw its reflection and differentiated itself from what was observed creating a dualistic perspective. yin and yang, light and dark, good and bad. It didnt see that it was still it, just as it is and embrace it, it saw it as something entirely different unrelated to itself. In a split second it differentiated itself therefore creating YOU. But you was there before it labeled you as different. You is it and it is you. You was always it no matter what it calls you. 
To create is to change, change is either flowing into better states or its chaos. Chaos is not trusting, not being satisfied with what is, not finding the joy in what you are given, or refusing to accept what is. Chaos happens when we differentiate ourselves from you. 

If we all just fucking stop and go in together, we have the the resources, technology, and wisdom to create an ACTUAL UTOPIA. Where we all enjoy.

1577204022,"If we can change our path at any time, how do our pets know where to meet us?","I’m pretty high, so this is probably going to take some sharp corners, but will hopefully all come together by the end.

For the sake of this discussion, we are assuming reincarnation is real, and that our pets come back to us.

A little background- I’m an animal communicator, and I’ve worked with some amazing ones.  One foretold the return of two of my cats-separate instances- and they are amazing stories, (but too lengthy to tell here).  

No matter the scenario, they would have to know I was going to find them, which would assume two very sure things- that I would be at a certain place at a certain time, and I would know it was them, even without any outside help or knowledge of animal communication.  My AC told me with absolute, fine details where I was going to find them, which means somehow it’s already written.  If *anything* can be predicted, which history has shown it’s been done, that means its predetermined.  A predetermined disaster would have to be predetermined for thousands, if not millions.

But let’s bring it back down to the scale of just us and our pet (I use the word “pet” for ease of conversation, but I don’t like it, so assume “animal companion” in its place).

It could take weeks, months, or years of preparation- them being born and surviving.  Of them being in one spot, waiting for us to show up.  

If our existence isn’t predetermined, how would this be arranged?  It could be  that nothing comes into existence until the moment we observe it, or that there is no free will- the script is already written.  Maybe the animal exists, and my cat joins its soul when I come onto the scene.  It’s known at least within the psychic/medium community that souls are able to step in and out at will, and even exchange souls for the rest of the body’s life.

So, my cat decides to come back because our time together here isn’t finished, and their life spans are so much shorter that they get to get a fresh body.  What are the possibilities here:

1.  *Because* a psychic is able to foresee their return with jaw-dropping accuracy, our lives are already set in stone, down to the fine details of where we will be, and when, without a single thing being able to veer us off course.  This theory would actually include the soul-swapping theory, because it’s assuming something already exists as well.

2.  Nothing comes into being until we observe it, which is backed up by the wave theory (that a particle behaves as a wave when not observed, and a “solid” when being observed, in a nutshell, and I probably have that fucked up somehow).  

If someone is able to see into our future, what are they seeing?  I guess that’s the real question here.  I’m going to post and get out of my head so I can hear some other thoughts besides my own.

1576944237,Christmas Cards in Primary schools.,"Hi! Me again. I was talking to my 6 year old sister about school when I was walking her back home, and she told me she was given Christmas cards from 8 different people. Now if you think of it, say there's 30 kids in a class (31 is the limit here), and each card is say, 10cm^2. if 8 people give everyone else (29) a card, that's a total of 232 (8x29) cards (Maybe 240 if you count the teacher, but cmon, who the fuck actually gave the teacher a Christmas card in my primary). That is then 2320cm^2 of card. These cards are folded in half. Double it, 46.4m^2 of card (the card is probably about 1mm thick, but I'm not going to take that into consideration, because I'm high as fuck and that's a bit too complicated). That is in one classroom. My class did that for a total of 5 years before we grew out of it. Multiply 46.4 by 5 and we get 232 (hello again). That's in one classroom. Multiply that by another 5. 1160m^2. Of card.

Conclusion: 
In the space of 5 years, 1160m^2 PLUS of card is used in primary schools to give to other people, to be thrown into the bin the next day. Imaging how many trees could be saved.

1576820487,Consequences of the dehumanization of madness on the collective mind," The continued dialectic of  villifcation of madness and the various phenomenon which are labelled as ‘mentally ill’ in our society, such as ‘grandiose delusions’, ‘hallucinations’, ‘paranoia’, etc., a long with all the other countless ‘disorders’, represents a form of collective repression that not only has unspeakably dire results for those so labelled, but wreaks utter havoc on the collective unconscious and the collective conscious. Rather than being the shamans, the spiritual leaders of society, such men and women are quietly tortured and cast into ignominy. Thereby, society is not only deprived of its natural guiding elite, but everyone in society is trained to feel a senseless (‘paranoid’) fear and hatred of their own deepest spiritual roots, that prevents them re-connecting with these forbidden aspects of themselves and manifesting their true potential.  
 Take for instance ‘paranoia’. This stigmatization of questioning the benevolent motives and fundamental agendas of one’s government is one of the most cynical and blatant causes of that government getting out of control and the citizenry failing to protect their own rights and freedoms. The same applies to all the other associated phenomenon of madness, which as has been argued, represent a perenial bed-fellow and midwife of intellectual and spiritual awakening. Just as the criminalization of drugs produces an association between drug-use and general criminality that does not exist independently,  re-validating society’s negative view of drug-use in its own eyes, so the category of mental illness and the inhumane, disabling treatments with which those who fall subject to it suffer, is not merely a product of but re-inforces and creates society’s negative attitude to those who manifest these various ‘mad’  phenomenon.  
	All the while, the fact that the sacred key to everybody’s own self-realization is so maligned and spat upon understandably produces a deep, unacknowledged sense of disconcertedness and pessimism in the population as a whole, the root cause of many other of society’s ailments and self-destructive tendencies. In truth, the *real* mental illness is the senseless conformity which the ‘mental health’ establishment sacralizes. This sanctified madness then, unconsciously aware of its own short-comings, in order to sustain its own self-conception as reasonable and sane, is driven to ever more fervent quest to identity and persecute those it delusionally deems ‘mad’, for the sake of externalizing and thereby gaining some sense of control over its own deepest insecuries, and having an Other to label &amp; stigmatize in opposition to which it can re-affirm its own false, insecure and groundless sense of Self",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/ed5t1c/consequences_of_the_dehumanization_of_madness_on/,gaslitbyamadman

If you can imagine building bigger and better and more powerful computers that can compute more data faster and faster, you'll eventually realize that:

The universe *is* a computer (the only computer) that can calculate the universe. 

It's just a testiment to its great complexity that it's so unimaginably large.

If you could create a computer fast enough to process all data about the universe it would require that:

* Retrieving indexed information about the universe would be limited to the speed of light. Retrieving data would require methods such as spaceships and radio waves to transmit.
* You would have to create programs (i.e. humans or other life) to be able to retrieve, compile, or process certain data.
* You would need a lot of power supplies to run the whole operation (stars).

How cool is that? Like I don't mean to dinegrate the work of the programmers or the artists or the marketers that made this all possible. Cause this wouldn't have happened with their work.

But let's just appreciate that.

Here we call it upvoting, on Facebook it is just ""liking"", on Twitter it's retweeting (modulo some dynamics), and really it's all the Internet and history and all creation. 

The system just repeatedly confirms that it exists and that it is awesome. Like a grand, all-important, all-encampsing Power on Self Test. But not quite cause that would suggest it then needs to move on to doing something else.

So for example, the reason a common house fly is so sharp with its movements is because the transactions performed by the nerves between the brain and sensor is far quicker than that of a humans, meaning more information is passed through the brain producing a slowed down world, enabling the fly to see things coming and have greater time to react.
So, as we know, when we smoke pot, the packet data sent between the brain and sensors also increases, just like the fly's does. The brain breaks down this rapid, more intense flow of data and the senses become more sensitive as more data is received. So in theory, the mind is working at a faster pace, and with us going faster, the world becomes some what slower, and a little more perceivable.

1296425479,I was picking my nose and I started bleeding,"I'll be using Daniel Dennet's understanding of consciousness for this and I'll use a similar example to his. Basically, the human body is a boat with a crew on board out at sea. The captain says what to do, but without the information provided by the crew (sensory receptors [such as eyes, taste buds, ear drums, nerves) about the boat's physical condition (muscles, organs, bones), the captain can't do anything.

When I went to pick my nose my receptors were telling the rest of me faulty information (where my nostrils were located in relation to my finger; plus other information) and so my nail scraped against the inner wall of my nostril and I began to hurt.

While my nose was feeling pain and telling the rest of me that the boat was compromised, my finger was telling information about the texture of the inner wall of my nose (that I cringe to think of) and my collective self was thinking, in primitive terms, ""my body is not under attack, lower my fear and worry about stopping the bleeding."" 

It all happened in an instant and it left me wondering if it's possible to attack oneself as if one was at the same time ""the self"" and ""the other"" without it being an accident. I would assume that certain brain damage/trauma/psychological problem can allow for this. What about other circumstances? Is there anything to learn from this reaction?

1296710794,My drunk take on Any Rand.,"The main problem with ""objectivism"" - despite the fact that it's a misnomer, and actually describes a type of subjectivism - is that it is hypocritically myopic. I'll give it this much - insofar as an economic system in an ideal planet wher...e everyone has adequate access to a fair and sustainable share of resources, it is an EXCELLENT philosophy. Unfortunately we live in the real world, where there are places (such as El Paso, for example) that exist primarily as trading posts and have no natural resources to build a self sustaining economy. If individual economies cannot sustain themselves, then to expect every region of the world to be able to meet AND feel economic pressures equally is a pipe dream. Areas with copious amounts of natural resources have a sort of (if I can borrow a term from science) Maxwell's Deamon keeping the economic entropy of the region low. The PROBLEM is that economics and politics are tied, so while Rand may work economically in an imaginary, ideal planet, the current political climate of the world, in conjunction with the Ayn Randian philosophy it operates on (especially in the US) is unsustainable. And that's true even when you completely ignore peak oil. Sure, in a smaller system your business might fail and you just pack up and move somewhere else, like in El Paso when they recently decided to drop a Walmart on dyer near Fred Wilson. The local meat market should pack up and GTFO because they are well within their means to do so. On the other hand, when we are speaking globally, one cannot simply pack up and move to a different country. Sure, they can in theory, but what happens economically when the main, singular supplier of a pariticular natural resource is unable to sustain themselves via the free market, and furthermore, due to the sociopolitical climate? Then they all abandon their mines and the world is completely depleted of a critical resource because everyone who lived there skipped town. How is that a long term, sustainable strategy? It's not, and we are only sustaining an illusion by pretending that the world can sustain itself any longer at its current capacity without crashing into both political and economic turmoil. Yes, i love having the internet and all this awesome shit that we Americans enjoy, but IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. This WILL end someday. Maybe sooner than later.

Remember, we human beings - and everything we've built - are a part of nature.

~**Spreading Eternally**~

*Their eyes have been opened, they can never go back*

A step apart from the distractions

An introspective glimpse of history

To feel what is real

A potent unconscious decree 

The matter inside oneself 

Is only there momentarily

A cosmic recycler 

Blending to infinity

Spreading eternally

A realization of existence 

Comes with a sense of anxiety

A bold step to get a grasp

Of the wonders of reality

~**Spiral Staircase**~

United as one existence

To all realms of infinite space

Distance is only time

Flowing down the spiral staircase

From birth to mortality

Their eyes rarely look beyond historical understanding... It's beautiful - a desire to know the unknown will never satisfy

Falling forever

Into the spiral staircase

Chasing space

Life so limited, so bleak

For the universe to speak

Risen consciousness

The road to wisdom is always bliss

Time plays for keeps

And the blind eye is always asleep

For the universe to speak

Meaning – is what to seek

1298332196,Nothing is the Cause of Our Existence,"To say that nothing is the cause of our existence is quite a bold statement. How can something that does not exist be the driving force for everything that does exist? How do we even physically describe such an abstract concept of nothingness? It is hard for us as humans to even begin to conceptualize what infinity is, but what if we were to reverse this thought process and start to think about what nothing means. In the following statements, I will attempt to prove how this void that I will now refer to as Nothing is the something that has brought about the existence of the ever expanding universe that we reside in.

Before the Big Bang the entirety the universe existed as a single mass that contained every single piece of matter that ever did, does, and ever will exist. We would like to assume that because the universe is expanding uniformly that prior to the Big Bang this primordial mass also existed in uniformity. What could possibly disrupt such a beautifully harmonious existence?

It goes against all common sense to believe that anything could potentially pull off this feat, yet we know that something did. But what was that something? If God were the prime mover it would infer that said entity exists outside of everything, which begs the question, “If you add something (God) to everything, was everything even everything to begin with?” A similar question can also be posed, “If you take away something from everything, is everything still everything?” So, if we take away Nothing from everything, is everything still everything? That depends on whether or not Nothing is a something.

So, is Nothing something? Well, yes... and no. Nothing is not a physical thing, but rather a state of being when everything we know ceases to exist. Nothingness is a complete void. More than anything, Nothing is an idea and giving it a physical description is almost impossible. The closest thing to compare Nothing to is a vacuum, but physicists will argue that things can still happen within the confines of a vacuum. In regards to a vacuum, there exists physical constraints on size; however, what if we set the parameters on the size of the vacuum equal to boundaries of the universe. Simply put, these boundaries do not exist. When the Universe becomes so large that all matter in the universe is ultimately negligible, what then? Have we achieved the ideal vacuum? At this point in time, their will be no gravity, no electromagnetism, no nuclear forces. Light, sound, and heat will all be meaningless. In an almost inconceivable vacuum, we reach a state of Nothing.

If the Universe is everything and Nothing is something, it would lead one to believe then that Nothing must be included in everything that existed prior to the Big Bang. Yet we know that this singularity was full of substance and far from existing in a state of Nothing. For argument’s sake, let’s give the Universe a value of 1 in its primordial state and a value of 0 in its state of Nothing. During its transition and even in its states of 1 and 0, it is always the Universe, it is always everything, and it is always in existence, it is simply existing in different states of being. That being said, it is impossible for the Universe to exist in these conflicting states simultaneously. Think of time as being the transitory state between the instant when the Universe exists as as a single mass and the instant when the Universe exists as an infinite nothing. In order for the Universe to truly exist as Everything, it must exhibit Nothingness.

While I have posed more questions than I have answered, the beauty lies in that there can never be an answer to most of these questions nor can any of this nonsense ever be proven. So in good nature, I will leave you with even more unanswerable questions. Is it even possible that a future state of being is the driving force behind an explosion that began 14 billion years ago?

Arbiatry morality, however, allows for action to go unjudged since they cannot be rooted by their source. And so these action are only contested by a reaction; not a collection of dialogue deciding the morality of the action and how it belongs in a society (a society that can be rooted to its source [culture, etc that all center around morality]). This seems to be a tautology, but isn't relativism one big tautology?

The significance of judgment is its relation to objectivity and its ability only to efficiently exist in an objectified starting point. And without objectiveness, you are left without morality.

1299001594,Is meta meta- the most meta you can get?,"It seems that with a lot of things, once recurrence happens the question of the limit of recurrence is brought up.

I was thinking about the concept of ""meta"" used in popular culture. The reason why I think that meta is of interest is because it makes us feel more assure of our believes because we consider our manner of considering. 

An example would be when we use our own observations of our own psychology to measure the soundness and rationality of a thought process. To highlight bias, misconceptions, and unjustified implications without referencing other people. 

But the thing with meta is that once you study metaphysics and move on to question meta metaphysics (or something of the sort) then the two concepts can just reference one another. By rule of parsimony, we would have to justify a third meta (perhaps this applies to other concepts other than ""meta"") but we would not have to justify a second meta because up to that point nothing could be used to measure the first meta.

Ta da

**Edit** After reading this at a [0] I would only clarify that to justify a third meta, the third meta would have to fulfill tasks that meta and meta meta cannot. Even if one were to use meta meta meta, it would be considerably weaker, and the 4th would be even weaker still and so on.

Humans have created an eternal world with computers. 

With everything in life, there is change and eventual decay. I feel like nothing in life is truly stagnant as we're all affected by our environment. This is not true for computers. There is no decay in a computers world. There is no change (unless programmed). If you tell a computer to display a blue color, it will display that exactly blue color till the end of time. You could pull up images from reddit in 1000 years and see no change (in the computer world). This is probably the best grasp of eternity we can have, as everything a human knows eventually changes. Computer parts and things that exist in the real world will naturally age and decay with time, but digitally - everything is everlasting. Everything you submit to the internet is everlasting unless changed by a program or another individual. This post itself after submission can only be affected by the outside world, computer programming inside of it, or an external moderator. If these things did not exist and if theoretically parts never decayed, the information would last endlessly.

1299496984,A universe of conscious cells,"We consist of huge societies of separate lifeforms. There are trillions of living cells in the human body. They do not have nervous systems or sense organs with which they could experience the outside world in the same way as we can. Their ways of interacting with one another are quite limited.

Regardless, how can we know for certain that our cells are not conscious? What is the requirement for consciousness, a sufficiently complex network of brain cells? Consciousness need not be the same thing as recognizing yourself in a mirror. It does not require analytical reasoning to ""feel alive"" and to have experiences. Being conscious in the present moment does not benefit from having memories from the past, or planning for the future. Consciousness in its most basic form might be a common feature of all lifeforms.

What then could be the experience of, say, a muscle cell? It doesn't see, taste, think or feel as we do. It picks up nutrients from the bloodstream, receives oxygen from red blood cells, releases CO2 into the bloodstream, receives commands from nerve cells and is directly connected to its neighboring muscle and bone cells. It may not make independent decisions on anything, but maybe it has the ability to at least experience its own functions and maybe even be aware (by its dependence of other cells) that it's a part of some bigger entity, an incredibly complex ecosystem of different cells?

1299673823,Cosmology of Vibration (everything is vibrating energy),"I originally posted this on /r/philosophy, and they did not appreciate it. Since I came up with it while high, I think it's only fair to share it with you all (thank God I finally found you...)!

I'm going to take you inside matter, inside energy, into that which makes up everything. Then we're going to come back out, and take a look at the different religious philosophies of life, and connect it all to what we're doing right now - the present moment. And that's what it's all about.

===== The Cosmology of Vibration =====

PART 1: THE MATERIAL

Look around the room you’re in right now. Everything you see, and most of the things you don’t, is made up of atoms (surprise!). Each of these atoms is in turn made up of various kinds of subatomic particles, which combine in different ways to form the several dozen atoms that make up our universe. 

In between these atoms and subatomic particles is [huge amounts of space]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kypne21A0R4), proportional to the vast distances between stars and galaxies. These particles, specifically electrons, repel one another to give us the illusion of matter. Objects in the world don’t actually touch each other. The electrons in your hands are repelling the electrons in the keyboard, similar to the way magnets repel one another. We conceptualize of electrons as traveling in orbits, but we know that’s [not really true]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital). 

Going further in, subatomic particles are made up of almost infinitely smaller particles, like quarks. In between those particles are even more incredibly vast distances of space. These particles are called “elementary particles,” meaning they aren’t themselves made up of anything further, but that’s probably not true. We used to think atoms were elementary. 

As we travel further and further inside matter, the only constants appear to be empty space and energy. This energy [vibrates in varying frequencies]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECkG_JdodMA&amp;feature=related) (minute 4 or so) within the void, repelling itself, creating what we believe is matter. This makes sense, since matter and energy are [interchangeable]( http://www.deism.com/images/einfun.jpg). And this completes the illusion of our physical world.

But matter isn’t the only thing that can be described by vibrations. Light and magnetism are of course [waves of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation), and waves themselves are an [expression of vibration]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave). “Color” is just our eyes and brains interpreting certain wavelengths of light. “Sound” is just our ears and brains interpreting vibrations within matter. Even gravity is believed to act as a [vibrating wave]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_radiation).

Thus, our physical universe is really just an expression of fluctuating and vibrating energy, interpreted by our senses.

PART 2: THE NON-MATERIAL

Now that we look at the universe through this lens, certain common denominators among the world religions start to make more sense logically.

The Abrahamic traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, mainly) are so grouped not just because they share Abraham as their spiritual grandfather, but because aside from some small (and admittedly key) details, they all worship an [essentially similar God]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_conceptions_of_God). This God is described as being eternal, omniscient, omnipresent, indivisible, a “creator,” unknowable, and unreachable. However, this God, described in the Abrahamic traditions as a being, can be communicated with – each religion disagrees on how, but certainly, no religious person will deny that one can *feel* God.

The Indian religions (namely Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism) appear to share little else than geography in common – each stemming from the Vedic religion in India. Hinduism features a baffling array of gods, deities, prophets, and saints – but at its core, Hinduism is less about the worship of particular deities and more about the [practice of worship]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindusim#Beliefs) itself. It’s not uncommon in India (I’ve been lucky enough to travel there) to find shrines of Jesus or Mary next to shrines of Ganesh. And even so, Hinduism features Krishna as its principal creator. Krishna has a universal form which is everything and nothing, he is omnipotent and omniscient, and is [depicted]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Avatars_of_Vishnu.jpg) with sometimes hundreds of arms and heads looking in all directions, to symbolize this omnipresence. 

Jainism and Buddhism share the core idea of a soul, which is potentially divine, and seeks to become one with the universe. The religions differ on how a soul achieves this enlightened state, but they agree that such a state exists – and that enlightenment is the realization of becoming one with the universe (Nirvana in Buddhism), which can be achieved during life – it’s not an afterlife. 

Finally, the Taoic traditions (Taoism, Mahayana Buddhism, Shinto, and others) are all centered around the idea of the Tao. To try to describe the Tao, they believe, is pointless (just try out [/r/Taoism]( http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/) for yourself), and you have to describe *around* it to get it. The Tao cannot be known, only understood. At that point, you become enlightened, and that is when you realize your essential part in the one-ness of the universe as a whole.

To me, these religions are coming from very different places, cultures, and belief systems (it’s these culturally subjective values which form the different religions in the first place) and attempting, I believe, to arrive at essentially the same idea: the full and real understanding of the universe, including you, as being one vibration of energy. Of course the western religions, growing out of Aristotle’s subject/object dualism, regard this energy or vibration as something (or someONE) separate, apart from yourself, whereas the eastern religions, based more on the idea of the universal singularity, see it as less a being and more a state OF being. 

The realization of this singularity of vibration is what some call enlightenment.

PART 3: EVERYTHING ELSE

Now that we have those ideas unified, we can start to see where this applies everywhere. For example, the [Golden Rule]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule), the ethical standard that I think no one would really disagree with, and which is present in almost every single belief system and even rule of law around the world, is obvious when you consider that we are all varying expressions of this vibrating energy. You have to treat others as you would want to be treated, because in a way, you *are* others. You are treating yourself; or, more accurately, the universe is treating itself.

Most qualities we prize in people - generosity, humility, honesty, charisma - we prize because they are inclusive and shy away from the idea of being ""separate."" Those qualities we shun - greed, pride, dishonesty, rudeness - these things are exclusive, and encourage the ""me vs. you"" subject/object dualism.

Art is a debate in itself, but if art is a communication between artist and viewer, then it's a communication of unspoken communion as one in the universe. If art is just an experience, and not a communication, then it's an experience of momentary realization of this singularity.

Even most good advice we receive, which ends up sounding the same everywhere – be yourself, be passionate about what you do, live in the moment, *Carpe Diem*, simplicity is better - all these ideas have been around for thousands of years, and all universal stories come derive their themes from these basic ideas. 

And all of them, of course, seem obvious when you realize what we’re all made of. The greatest prayer, the greatest homage, the finest dissection of our world is having your mind open to the present moment, understanding what you are and opening yourself to the chaotic nature of the vibrating universe.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/g0e0j/cosmology_of_vibration_everything_is_vibrating/,LeJavier

The brain operating system has to reboot every time an absurdity or logic error crashes the main consciousness software. 

During the reboot, you have to relive your entire life in a single moment, which is why we spaz out for a couple seconds. We're living in super fast forward for that moment. 

Most of the time you don't realize this is happening, but when you completely open your mind to observation, then you can see your own thoughts like Matrix Code.

Marijuana is the red pill. Sort of like virus of the mind -- a trojan horse that allows you to hijack your own brain using stack overflows, brute force, etc. However, pot is a very ineffective red pill. The brain is built to automatically fix up any logical incongruities, and will do so as soon as it can. This is the process of sobering up.

Any ideas that do not get ""corrected"" before the brain patches up the bug, become part of that persons real ideas and beliefs.

Schizophrenia is when someone has completely gone inside their own consciousness and their brain was unable to recover and rebuilt the logical circuitry. Full blown mind AIDS.

Enlightenment is free, unrestricted passage between consciousness and subconsciousness. This does not destroy the ego, but rather creates a meta-ego. A set of all sets, or ego of all egos, so to speak.

This is where [Russell's Paradox](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gatnr/can_someone_explain_russells_paradox/) comes into play. A *set of all-sets-that-don't include-themselves* is just another way of saying death and void. Because the set of all sets that do include themselves is enlightenment and life.

So death must necessarily include life. But not the other way around, as humanity has been falsely assuming this whole time.

For example, the [Golden Rule]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule), the ethical standard that I think no one would really disagree with, and which is present in almost every single belief system and even rule of law around the world, is obvious when you consider that we are all varying expressions of this vibrating energy. You have to treat others as you would want to be treated, because in a way, you *are* others. You are treating yourself; or, more accurately, the universe is treating itself.

Most qualities we prize in people - generosity, humility, honesty, charisma - we prize because they are inclusive and shy away from the idea of being ""separate."" Those qualities we shun - greed, pride, dishonesty, rudeness - these things are exclusive, and encourage the ""me vs. you"" subject/object dualism.

Art is a debate in itself, but if art is a communication between artist and viewer, then it's a communication of unspoken communion as one in the universe. If art is just an experience, and not a communication, then it's an experience of momentary realization of this singularity.

Even most good advice we receive, which ends up sounding the same everywhere – be yourself, be passionate about what you do, live in the moment, *Carpe Diem*, simplicity is better - all these ideas have been around for thousands of years, and all universal stories come derive their themes from these basic ideas. 

And all of them, of course, seem obvious when you realize what we’re all made of. The greatest prayer, the greatest homage, the finest dissection of our world is having your mind open to the present moment, understanding what you are and opening yourself to the chaotic nature of the vibrating universe.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/gj8xw/cosmology_of_vibration_everything_is_made_up_of/,LeJavier

1303863345,My thoughts on perception from r/trees [8},"We assume in our daily lives that we all sense the same things in the same ways. A box has 6 sides, peanuts taste salty and C# sounds exactly so. Generally, we can identify things by describing them in ways we agree on.

Consider if, however, everybody sees things in a completely different way. It would seem completely alien to any other individual. What I see as blue could be, what I would say, is green to somebody else. Yet we still both agree that the color is blue. This assumes that we share the same perception when it comes to the very laws of the universe.

Such laws are things that we have described and agreed upon, however, which would mean they would be different for everyone. What you see as the color blue could have absolutely no meaning in my perception; it would be a completely foreign sensation. But because our sensations can also be identified and described, one could see your sensations as working in the same fashion as their own. Thus, the illusion of a common perception is formed and we assume that we all see the same way.

1304382626,My thoughts on Space and Time,"I've attempted to abandon my physical self and wander beyond what my sober perception allows.
 
I breathed the cool, empty air above the heights of the tallest mountains.
I saw the clouds break and glanced upon the vast, immense black vista of space towering above Earth's atmosphere.
 
The brutal, uninviting vacuum failed to slow me down in my ascent. My curious spirit breached the freezing nothingness of cosmos and flew upon our Moon. I stood on the desolate, chalky surface of the sterile orb and journeyed towards the cold, dark side. Envision the amazing hostility of the far side. A place where the sun will never shine and our kind has never set foot on. Beyond the already astounding horizon of a dead face of a dead satellite lies an even greater expanse. The incredible distances of further celestial bodies is overwhelming. However, this is just where it starts. Our solar system is more-or-less known and well studied, but beyond it's bonds lies a colossal range of interstellar neighbourhoods.
 
There are literally dozens if not hundreds of similar systems in a currently unreachable distance from our home world. These are all contained in the Milky Way galaxy, which dwarfs us like a beach is to a speck of sand. However, the staggering explosion of distance continues. Our own uncharted Milky Way is overshadowed by a galactic group that contains the massive Andromeda galaxy that embodies twice, maybe thrice the number of stars and planets. Even the numerically ridiculous galactic group is just an insignificant spot on the Virgo supercluster. We could continue my journey even further, but already I am amazed and intrigued by my meaningless in the face of the monstrous known universe. I exponentially accelerated my rise but I stupidly underestimated the cosmos. 
 
Even more horrifying is that my voyage was purely in space and excluded time. Time is unthinkably more mysterious, shrouded by our minuscule perception. There must be what we imagine as almost-infinite events, locations, beings, spirits, molecules, elements, atoms in our universe. My humble human mind can't imagine or handle the variations, contrasts and expressions of all that existed and exists. 
 
Nothing truly changes. Nothing is ever truly erased or truly created. Everything changes, modifies and adapts. My mind will detoriate, my body will rot and my legacy will be forgotten. I shall become dust, lifeless matter. But this dust will not stay in that state. It will collapse and eventually burn when our Sun shall evolve into a red giant and consume our world. The dust will remain in space and will be driven by time. One day(figuratively, as a solar day is utterly insignificant in cosmic-grade time) I may escape the binds of our dying sun and perhaps participate in the creation of something purely new. Or maybe I will become a cold black dwarf, the corpse of a once blazing sun, desolate and remote.
 
Space provides while Time advances.

The only other character is someone who does not live in the physical world but is inside it, in the sense that he exists in peoples minds. The mind is the only place that anything can be truly said to exist. The outside world is only known to us as it appears within us by the testament of our senses. The imagination is the most real world that we know because we each know it first hand. Seeing our ideas take form is like being able to see the sun come into being. We have no equivalent to the purity of that in our account of the outside world. The outer world appears to each of us as one thing and it is always also a multitude of others. Inside to outside and outside to inside are never-ending. Trying and giving up are a form of breathing.

My describing The Empyrean as a story is accurate from my viewpoint, but misleading, as there are no road signs to lead someone else to perceive a clear story out of it. There was no intention to write what would be seen as clear-cut story, though it is one to me. Being that it takes place in the mind of one person, no laws of time and space, or concrete relationships exist therein. This is to say that if you look into it with your logical brain you will only strain yourself and come up with nothing. The words were specifically written to document an inner experience of life, the kind that a person has extreme difficulty translating to anyone else. Part of the intention was to write words to connect with other people who have been, or are, overwhelmed by the confusing, inescapable inner world they must live in. Equal attention was given to writing words that would gently direct themselves towards the listeners' intuitive brain, and their sub-conscience, which I believe comprehends and catalogues everything in a much richer and more multi layered way than our conscious mind. Like a lot of lyrics, it was written to be perceived in as many ways as there are people hearing it. A person to whom the words have no clear, conscious meaning may derive more from it than someone who reads it as I do, and so I recommend hearing or reading it however you will. It would have been simpler to say nothing at all but this only fully occurred to me today, as I have gradually realized that by saying what it is to me, I am encouraging people to see it my way and to me, that's not what rock lyrics are for. I believe rock lyrics should be open to interpretation and I wrote these so they could be. While I could explain the story as I see it that would detract from the potential multifarious meanings that will come about from people applying their own sense of feeling from their life experience, much as they always do.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/h9djl/john_frusciante_on_his_album_the_empyrean/,tutelhoten

After studying the problem for a few years, I've come to the conclusion that computers understanding natural language is not that far off at all.

Once computers understand natural language, all bets are off. The ability for humans to research and create becomes exponentially faster by just asking the computer to do what you want at all times. Suddenly anyone can program simply by speaking.

Combined with the exponential increase of collaboration with games like Minecraft, people will soon be able to build whole worlds with mere thoughts.

Brain reading devices already exist, and they will be able to interface with brains much better with each passing year.

The future is coming extremely quickly in my opinion, and might happen faster than anyone had anticipated. Things could get out of hand very quickly.

I expected the technological singularity to happen at some point in the future but I didn't expect it this quickly.

You were on your way home when you died.

It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.

And that’s when you met me.

“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”

“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.

“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”

“Yup,” I said.

“I… I died?”

“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.

You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”

“More or less,” I said.

“Are you god?” You asked.

“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”

“My kids… my wife,” you said.

“What about them?”

“Will they be all right?”

“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”

You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.

“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”

“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”

“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”

“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”

“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”

You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”

“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”

“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”

“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”

I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.

“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”

“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”

“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”

“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”

“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”

“Where you come from?” You said.

“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”

“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”

“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”

“So what’s the point of it all?”

“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”

“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.

I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”

“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”

“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”

“Just me? What about everyone else?”

“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”

You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”

“All you. Different incarnations of you.”

“Wait. I’m everyone!?”

“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.

“I’m every human being who ever lived?”

“Or who will ever live, yes.”

“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”

“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.

“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.

“And you’re the millions he killed.”

“I’m Jesus?”

“And you’re everyone who followed him.”

You fell silent.

“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”

You thought for a long time.

“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”

“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”

“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”

“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”

“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”

“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”

And I sent you on your way. ",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/hdz61/this_belongs_here/,[deleted]

1305799324,Donald Miller on life.  (an excerpt from his book i just finished),"""I've learned too, that I don't really know very much about anything.  I mean, I used to have all these theories about life.  I thought I had everybody figured out, even God, but I don't.  I think the woods, being away from all the clingy soot of commercialism, have taught me life is enormous, and I am very tiny in the middle of it.  I feel, at times, like a droplet of water in a raging river.  I know for a fact that as a grain of sand compares in size to the earth itself, I compare in size to the cosmos.  I am that insignificant.  And yet the chemicals in my brain that make me feel beauty when I look up at the stars, when I watch the sunset, indicate I must be here for a reason.  I think I would sum it up this way: life is not a story about me, but it is being told to me, and I can be glad of that.  I think that is the why of life and, in fact, the why of this ancient faith I am caught up in: to enjoy God.  The stars were created to dazzle us, like a love letter; light itself is just a metaphor, something that exists outside of time, made up of what seems like nothing, infinite in its power, something that can be experienced but not understood, like God.  Relationships between men and women indicate something of the nature of God - that He is relational, that He feels love and loss.  It's all metaphor, and the story is about us; it's about all of us who God made, and God Himself, just enjoying each other.  It strikes me how far the commercials are from this reality, how deadly they are, perhaps.  Months ago I would have told you life was about doing, about jumping through religious hoops, about impressing other people, and my action would have told you this is done by buying possessions or keeping a good image or going to church.  I don't believe that anymore.  I think we are supposed to stand in deserts and marvel at how the sun rises.  I think we are supposed to sleep in meadows and watch stars dart across space and time.  I think we are supposed to love our friends and introduce people to the story, to the peaceful, calming *why* of life.

1306706605,Are we (humans) the orcs? ,"Consider this:

Elves are small in stature, slight in build, and relatively puny. Their focus in life is love, nature, art, and philosophy. They're very peaceful, hurting other creatures only in self-defense. 

Orcs are large, muscular, and powerful. Their focus is the acquisition of stuff, killing things, and having a rowdy good time in the process. They're cruel and violent.


There's an example in the real world of this: bonobos are smaller and weaker than chimpanzees, although they're related. Bonobos don't use tools like chimps do, although they're considered more intelligent and are certainly capable tool users when pressed. They make love in all kinds of positions, and have casual sex to reinforce social bonds, sometimes orally. Bonobos eat meat only rarely, primarily feeding on fruit and stuff. Chimpanzees are brutes that wage wars with other tribes, regularly kill for meat, and are generally ... orcish in nature. That makes bonobos the elves. Bonobos are almost extinct, and chimpanzees are very numerous, which also fits the model.

Does this theme occur more frequently? Why is the elf-orc dichotomy so prevalent in stories and cultures today? Although I'm less informed about other world cultures, it seems especially present in northern european stories...

I posit the following:

A population of neanderthals lived in what would become europe towards the end of the last major ice age. As the winters warmed and food supplies grew, another hominid population moved north. These newcomers were taller, stronger, and more vicious than the neanderthals. They used powerful spears to kill big game, and were driven to the cold north by rival tribes in the south. Arriving at their new home, they were displeased to find this weak and despicable race living there, claiming they'd ""been there since the world was thawed by the licking of the great mother cow"". What a bunch of bull! The newcomers raped and killed the smaller hominids, who were unused to war and the advanced weapons of their attackers.

Who were those newcomers in this allegory? Modern man.

Look at our society today. Would you not say that we, as a species, are closer to the popular vision of orcs than elves? Evolutionarily, the idea makes sense: elf-type hominids wouldn't stand a chance against orc-types (except for magic, which unfortunately doesn't exist). We can even see the process repeating itself in the world of apes today, so it's definitely not far-fetched.

Perhaps the appeal that elves have to our imagination are echoes of the 2% or so of our DNA that we've inherited from the neanderthals. Perhaps that's the magic they rely on in our stories. Perhaps that's why they're immortal.

1307175421,The Future of Humanity,"The War On Drugs is nothing more than a war on other people's values. If it is anything beyond that, it is simply an analogy of our inability to reconcile our personal differences at the cost of annihilating each other.

 

So why blame drugs? We could just as easily point to money as being the culprit of violence and corruption in the world. This doesn't even get into the matter of how pharmaceutical companies push their product on an undereducated, unquestioning population without prosecution; but rather legislative, judicial, and executive endorsement.

 

Obviously a system such as the government, built on money,  wouldn't do that. So we choose to fight drugs for the same reason we fight communism, other religions, or other sports teams.

 

It's a war of ideas, but not a lot of thought. We think we're the best without considering that maybe other people are happy the way they are.

 

Or, more cynically, perhaps it's purely contention itself from which people derive their meaning.

 

If that's the case, the world will not survive. So there's no point even considering that possibility unless you are a fatalist.

 

The only optimistic notion is that humanity is simply at an ideological and spiritual turning point where we may or may not fail depending on how quickly we can start respecting the planet and each other before we eradicate the possibility of the continuation of our species.

 

To even attempt to preserve our planet requires that we assume the latter, even if that notion is misguided desperation.

 

This is not to say I support drug use. I don't personally use drugs other than tobacco and alcohol, which are very much legal. And if you think you're somehow superior because you do not use these substances, consider the fact that caffeine and taurine are also drugs. Consider the fact that the definition of a drug is a substance which chemically alters your body and tell me if your naturalistic, herbal remedies do not fall into that category. Consider that even the food you eat and the air you breathe is systematically affecting your biological organism.

 

Who are you to choose what chemicals are legal for another human being to ingest?

 

And to keep from getting off track, this IS NOT an essay about drugs. Drug policies are simply an analogy for the sort of societal pressures we create and enforce against people engaging in activities we deem inappropriate, even when they are not by definition violent or inherently harmful to other people.

 

To allow outlaw drug use based on a supposition of possible negative societal effects is precedent enough to allow the illegislation of religion on those same bases.

 

After all, just because I think that Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or fundamental Naturalism (Science as a religion) is harmful to any given person or society does not mean that I should feel obligated to outlaw it, right?

 

There will always be conflict, though it seems that our society is intent on outlawing all conflict in a futile attempt, destroying freedom in the process. Leftists and Right-wingers alike have attempted to abolish offensiveness. Whether via banning violent video games, censoring explicit music, or stopping mosques from being built in the vicinity of ground zero. ""Vulgar"" non-politically correct language, homosexuality, and other offensive acts are being targeted by politicians on both sides of the aisle.

 

It's pretty clear we want to mandate normalization, but we just cant agree on what it means to be ""normal"" or acceptable.

 

This is a fight that will never end. We can't even agree on the wrongfulness of murder afterall. A story published in the newspaper about a beating  of someone you don't even know, but who is in close proximity to your home will cause a significantly more visceral reaction from you than the entire Darfur genocide. 
 

The proximity makes all the difference because we are selfish. That's why we choose to impose our values on others without any sense of relativism and with a complete sense of impunity.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/hredq/the_future_of_humanity/,AtheismFTW
1307193074,You will never be able to comprehend reality.,"Our reality is a construct of our mind. It is made up of our sensory inputs and analysed by primarily our instincts and what we have learned.

For example, no human being brought up in a 3 dimensional world will be able to comprehend the true nature of a 4 dimensional shape. Our instincts and our life experiences have taught us to live in a world of 3d.

We are also used to interacting with objects on a similar scale to us. We have no evolved to comprehend the colossal size of the universe or the minute sizes of atoms.
We can be told that the volume of the universe is 3.38×10^80 m^3, which is 5x10^77 times the size of the Earth, but there is *no possible way* we can visualise just how tiny our planet is, let alone how astonishingly small our bodies are. 

Another example is time. We have evolved to have a feel for the amount of days that have passed. Without using a calender at all you could probably hazard a rough estimate of the amount of years that have passed since a major event. We cannot truly grasp just how long 14billion years, the age of the universe, is nor just how small an average 80 year lifetime is in comparison.

And even all of this huge stuff is easier to conceive than the very small.  The half life of Darmstadtium (267Ds) is 3x10^-6 seconds. Sure, we can use this value in calculations and realise it is very small, but we cannot fully understand just how short a time period this is. To us humans, even a [millisecond](http://flash-clocks.com/blog/?p=558) passes faster than we can truly grasp, the numbers pass before we can even properly register them, and this is just x10-3 seconds.  


Even in our normal sized, normal speed world, we still don't see anywhere near the full picture. The [electromagnetic spectrum](http://www.antonine-education.co.uk/physics_gcse/Unit_1/Topic_5/em_spectrum.jpg) is so huge compared to what we can see.Even if all our mind is completely focused and all our senses are functioning properly, we see hardly any  of the world around us. Neither do we hear, taste nor smell anywhere near everything around us.
Hell, there might even be senses we have no idea exist. 



I was musing the other day about white blood cells. For all purposes they are living their own lives. Their lives involve hunting for food to survive, either bacteria or the nutrients in our blood. To them that is their life. They have no idea they are helping a greater body. To them, the blood is their world, there is no reason to think otherwise.

1307253506,My Hipster Hypothesis:,"Hipsters only exist because in our post-modern world these kids grew up noticing that practically every subculture in existence got made fun of. Punks, hippies, metalheads, etc all received a fair beating by the time the 90's rolled around. Hipsters saw that nothing was sacred. No cultural group was safe. So they saw that the only way to stay cool was to dodge categorization and the ability to be diminished (non-intentionally-- this wasn't like, planned out or anything.. just a reaction). And they appropriated things from many different subcultures and cultures in an attempt to avoid being diminished or ""uncool"".

Of course, this backfired, because anyone who didn't (or doesn't) ""get"" the essence of hipsterdom still managed to lump them into a subculture that they could hate on and finally understand. They're hipsters. Simple.

I think the backlash was/is especially strong (albeit mostly only verbally so) because they really do embody the notion that ""nothing is sacred"". They steal, pick and choose from other cultures and subcultures and therefore rearrange what the symbols of other cultures mean. This made the people who identified with those symbols kind of pissed off. And hipsters just kept doing it (and claiming it as their own).

    That it is actually a constant, and not linear, like space
    
     
    
    Maybe it's vice versa, it could go either way
    
    Both time and Space are things that always are, and don't progress -- as we perceive space
    
    Or they're both things that progress -- as we see time
    
    One location vs another could be a linear phenomena, like one time vs another

For those unaware, the big crunch theory is an explanation of the end of the universe. As the universe cools off, it fills with heavier and heavier metals. Supporters of the theory suggest that the universe will eventually settle into a state which possesses no thermodynamic free energy. At this point, the combined mass of the universe will begin to draw itself back inwards. Once all matter returns to the point of origin it will result in a singularity.

Applied cyclically, it is possible that another big bang could occur out of this singularity, and the universe could theoretically exist in an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction, with each expansion being punctuated by a big bang.

Empathy and the expanding complexity of communication helped to build societies. We began empathizing with people in our close proximity, forming communication only understood between these people, calling the groups tribes. We began to fight other tribes out of fear that they were different and therefore harmful. Then as we developed methods of transportation and more complex communication skills we expanded our empathy up until now, when we can fly anywhere and can communicate with people anywhere via the internet, and yet the leaders of our world see each other as threats to their freedom because they're too focused on their nation and only feeling empathy for their respective nation, or respective party. The people of this day and age should be ahead of their leaders with this new ""global empathy"", just so long as we don't pay too much attention to what our leaders say, at least until they realize that once the power of love overcomes the love of power, global empathetic peace can exist.

The fact that life was born on a planet of no particular significance is an illustration of the sheer scale of the universe.

Yet, our consumption of the natural resources that made our birth possible escalates to such a rate that our lives are unsustainable. We make our cradle of life inhospitable.

1308652329,Does the fractal nature of the universe say something about ourselves?,"We (humans) perceive ""reality"" at this particular level. We could call this the level of substance. Below this level is what it is composed of (molecules - atoms - quarks); above this level is what we make up (planetary system - solar system - galaxy). Now, depending on what matter we are trying to measure/perceive, it will either act more like a wave or more like a particle. It is all relative, though. If we are trying to measure/perceive something below the level of substance, that matter will act more and more like a wave the further down the ""rabbit hole"" you go, to the point where photons and electrons are most certainly waves when we AREN'T watching, but are particles when we ARE watching. Basically, we live in an infinite scape of waves; energy that when perceived will collapse into a particle.

BUT, who's to say that every being/entity in this universe perceives the same thing? While that may sound simple and obvious at first, I have a different spin on it. What if these waves collapse a certain way into a certain particle if and only if a certain type of being/species is the one doing the perceiving? The energy waves out there in objective reality are the same, but the way they collapse is unique for each type of entity watching. Then a problem arises: ""Well, what happens if a cat and a human are looking at the same thing?""...Matter can be non-local; it is a wave of probability; it can exist in multiple states at the same time and we would never know. If a cat is looking at the same thing that you are looking at, the energy you are perceiving is the same, but you will see a different particle than what the cat sees, simply because the energy is existing in different states at the same time.

If that were true (energy waves collapse differently depending on what is observing them), then does that say something about US? If that were true, then that means that the universe is fractal, but also self-similar to us. Our brains have a certain programmed way of observing these waves of infinite probability, and since it is inherent in us, it is a part of us and may say something about us. That would have huge implications. The study of the universe would merely be a study of ourselves, not of objective reality. It would be seemingly impossible to observe objective reality, since we turn the OBJective into something SUBjective.

My impulses and desires are residual characteristics from inherited traits.

These traits could have only been inherited because they somehow better helped my ancestors reproduce more efficiently.

Therefore, simple every day actions, which superficially could pass as sociological, habitual or subconscious are all vestigial quirks. 

This thought can be applied to anything in my life. For example, relationships. 

The desire to pair monogamously with a mate shares a direct connection with the survival of my future offspring by providing a stable upbringing (bigger brained mammal = longer interdependent childhood).

In modern society, we–as a group of sophisticated primates–have reached a point in which a social norm has developed around the idea of monogamy, to the point in which ""laws"" and ""bureaucracy"" govern the relationship.  

This should not, however tempting, detract from it's origin and ultimate purpose; ""purpose""–in the most literal sense of the word.

""Yes, you can. And you do not even need to leave the Earth to do it.

You are always viewing things in the past, just as you are always hearing things in the past. If you see someone do something, who is 30 meters away, you are seeing what happened (30m)/(3×108m/s)=0.1μs in the past.

If you had a mirror on the moon (about 238K miles away), you could see about 2.5 seconds into earth's past. If that mirror was on Pluto, you could see about 13.4 hours into Earth's past.

If you are relying on hearing, you hear an event at 30 m away about 0.1 s after it occurs. That is why runners often watch the starting pistol at an event, because they can see a more recent picture of the past than they can hear.

Has anyone ever considered that this line (""They saw that they did not die"" after consuming the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil) could possibly mean that they gained the intuition that death is a fantasy? What I mean is, the usual interpretation of the line is that God had somehow lied to them, telling them they would die if they consumed the fruit when clearly they didn't. But my idea is that if you think about the line in a bit different of a way, it could possibly mean that upon consuming the fruit that grants knowledge they now knew that even when their physical bodies cease to exist the ""real them"" or whatever doesn't actually die but reincarnates or something?

This would provide the US with the money it needs for it's budget, and give Google to opportunity to forge it's own government.
Now, I know, some people believe Google to be a looming scary orangization. Google is so big and omnipresent that it feels like a government agency. People forget that it's a NONgovernmental corporation, and as such its transparency and ethical practices are better than most corporations, if not all of them.
My vision is that Google could take over California, since Cali is so rife with debt. Google could host governmental decision-making processes in a combination social forum, much like our beloved Reddit itself, with subreddits for each agency. They could ask for input from the populus, thus handing some decision-making power back to the people. It could be a purer form of democracy than the current governemnt.
I also think that with the current US government ailing the way it is, GoogleNation could be a saftey valve. If they need more money, they can sell more land to Google. Google, interested in keeping their progenitor alive, could help the government get back on it's feet.

On another hand after i stopped laughing i realized that the reason why people are so ignorant to the truth on the topic of marijuana and it's uses/side effects is because of all these sites out there that the corporate community is putting out there as ""drug awareness"". what makes this so serious is to a less experienced person they go out there and read these sites and believe them which as someone with experience i know that its all about the expectation when using such mental tools so people out there have this propaganda ingrained in them since they were young schools etc. so yes while they still may try it possibly even a few times they are expecting bad or have the fear of having a bad experience and in turn this has pushed people away from it and strengthening their ignorant faith of the dangers of marijuana.

i guess the point i am trying to make is that marijuana is only illegal because the corporate world hates the idea of legalization and its because of all this blatantly obscure propaganda that sadly the current majority of the population voters believe it all.

1311843141,"On being a parent, having children, and the Universe (tangential rant)","So, a lot of people tell me that it's a phase. I always insist that it's not, it's a personal decision that I've reached as a result of who I am. I'm a guy that likes no responsibility. You might find that immoral, unethical, or even stupid. That's fine. But it's also fine that just-fuck-it-man-nothing-matters. So for someone like me, being a parent is like THE biggest responsibility, both evolutionarily and just mindfuckingly. You want me to take care of this organic chunk of ever-developing matter?

 Like what the fuck even is a baby man? We were all one...just some matter that reacts to the environment and that is entirely dependent on the environment. Of course genes are relevant, but the nature vs. nurture debate is irrelevant. Your genes were still formed by the collective evolutionary pathway experienced by all your ancestors. So we were a baby once...AND WE KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT THE INFORMATION WITHIN OUR GENES. this information, combined with the environment has molded everything that we are, literally (yes, literally).

So I'm gonna help pop one of these nifty things out, and then I have to make sure I respond to all its needs, sometimes its wants, and just generally keep it at a miserable and above state of being. Dead is the only thing worse than miserable. So to me, I just feel ""yech"" about being the cause of another, very rare (to our current knowledge) intricacy in the fabric of the universe; a little, very tiny, incredibly, infinitestimally, mind-numbingly small kink, wherein the patterns (or randomness or a combination) of the universe became conscious.

If you really think about it, what the fuck is this place? We all just sort of woke up here, do you know what I mean? I mean we've sort of made sense of it enough to not get killed by it, and shit even have a great time, but we still don't really know why we all woke up here, right?

Hardly ideal, but eventually this planet will die of natural causes if we don't kill it first. Better that we don't take down other planets with us?

EDIT: Ignore all the 'lifeless' rocks out there that make up the vast majority of the known universe. They aren't rare, thus are not of 'value', either as colonization targets, or as harbors of precious Life.

And when a planet dies, the problem isn't so much the rock being destroyed, as the life on it. Why? Well, although mass extinction is a natural event, it involved the loss of a much more 'rare' commodity than the loss of a rock orbiting a star. There are innumerable rocks orbiting stars.

If we consider it acceptable to colonize a planet that ALREADY has Life on it, thus endangering that Life just as we have here on Earth (currently about to enter a Mass Extinction Event due to man-made causes)....then we're operating by a sort of 'virus' model in which human needs are superior to everything else.

The omniscience comes into play after the simulation is complete, since such a scientist would have access to all the data in the simulated universe.

The omnipotence comes into play because such a scientist could control all the variables in our program.

This idea might remind you a bit of The Matrix, but it's not. Where in the matrix, God was himself a computer construct, a software program created within the Matrix by machines on the outside. Instead, the God I speak of would not necessarily be bound to our known physical reality or in any analogous reality, much as is the case in the monotheistic sense of the term ""God"".

Alternatively, imagine, for example, if we created in the future a very powerful video game console that would run artificial intelligence. And we made an equally advanced sequel to the video game The Sims. If that artificial intelligence was self aware and capable of processing emotions such as fear and affinity, wouldn't it then be sort of like my previous idea? The morality in the game is arbitrary and doesn't necessarily relate to the morality outside the game. Or is absolute morality an emergent property of all sentience, even that which has been programmed? I doubt it.

Could it be said that such a scientist or video gamer has a moral obligation to those software creations? Perhaps. Then again, such simulations could be used as an [endless fountain of knowledge](http://i.imgur.com/qxtGs.jpg).

Basically, for entertainment. You create a universe, and that in itself is very exciting. But then what? Should you sit back and watch this universe of yours having all the fun? No, you should have all the fun yourself. To accomplish this, God transformed into the whole universe. God is the Universe, and everything in it. But the universe doesn't know that because that would ruin the suspense. The universe is God's great drama, and God is the stage, the actors, and the audience all at once. The title of this epic drama is ""The Great Unknown Outcome"". Throw in potent elements like passion, love, hate, good, evil, free will; and who knows what will happen? No one knows, and that is what keeps the universe interesting. But everyone will have a good time.

1313784121,"Listen up, jumblers &amp; tumblers!","O, what if Plato's old vision was really true! That grand old man casting his mystical spell over our crazy Western civilization... 

That the laws of physics are merely the lowest-grade dumb stuff, completely uninteresting in their banal simplicity, excepting a few mildly-interesting lifeless elegances in the fields of quantum electrodynamics. That this may as well be created by some sort of devil as a crude joke — ha, see here God, can you make anything cool out of *this* yucky goo? I mean, when you study physics seriously, zoom in to the real meat of the universe, delve in there by reduction, and when you get close enough and really see it for what it is — it's basically *nothingness*, vast expanses of empty space, beyond blackness or invisibility, beyond death, and a handful of rigidly specified movement calculi for abstract types of fields (the pastoral metaphor is mere flattery).

We are supposed to believe that this autistic soup is the heart of reality, the real essence. Everything is just various types of delusion, denigrating notions like ""emergence,"" suggesting that any interesting *logos* here actually derives from the chaos, was always there from the start, a 180 degree reversal of the obviously true situation.

Namely that there must exist, ontologically, a complexly immanent framework of structure, a large and beautiful organization of the causal relations, which is so dynamic in every dimension that it (and perhaps only it) truly deserves the name ""True Life"", ""Soul"", or ""God."" This living meta-structure includes everything, is everything, is the creative drive in every process, the working of cosmic reason, the word made flesh.

What, then, is faith? It is only the realization that one is nothing but a particle of God's plan, that the only absolutely true perspective is that of Spinoza's pantheism, and that the Spinozan identification of God as the Constantly-Creating Creativity in Nature is truly another equally valid conception of true monotheism, and that devotion and love is a pre-made attractor in the Field of Excellence, that Virtue is Identifiable as Strong Loving Life, the completely serene life, absolutely harmonious, yet incessantly working for all beings, the bodhisattva life.

Our codified stale ethics are unnecessary, they are second-rate emulations of the real thing, they are icon-sized thumbnails of true goodness, true justice, true love. This is why all great prophets are minimalists in ethics. They uncalcify, they cause withering trees to bloom. They bring peace and disruption: individual peace in the midst of social disruption. Nietzsche totally missed the arcane truth of Buddhism when he described the Buddha as a profet for a declining, decadent culture — or maybe we've missed the arcane truth of Nietzsche. He might have seen its Original Secret Plan, to install the trojan horse that keeps the truth alive, to bring God down through the darkening ages in a cloak of disguise, a kind of invisibility suit.

What, my friend, you do not believe the yogis of Northern India and the sages of Asian Mahayana were every bit as intelligent, discerning, skillful, and careful as you? 
You do not think they created a soul science, beyond the dualism of reason vs subjectivity, mind vs body, self vs others? You really think the transmission of Dharma could be anything but a Significant Substructure in the Dynamically Perfect Web of Action and Thought, or a Truly Magnetic Love between the Reflective Mind and the Wonderful Workings? Nahh! You need to sit down and meditate!

Just do it, right now. Drop your distance from the experience: you already are the Experiencer Behind Experience, the Original Face. Cut off all discursive thought; from this let your thoughts emerge in alignment with the true direction of reason: the Mysterious Origination of Consciousness from Chaos. But this is already the alignment; there is nothing you have to do. So just stop not doing it and a great faith will fill you; you will become faith itself.

If you find a True Master to guide you, a community alive with the Beating Dharma Heart, you have a failsafe vehicle for the Great Liberation. You are connected to a Sacred Map of Obscure Origin from the Buzzing Dharma Forests of the Axial Age, and with this you have a true guide to the Terrain of Transformation. The singular enlightenment is not an easy target, but you will find a true glimmer of hope in the feeling of Rising Soul, a trustily increasing Robustness of Divine Connection, a Higher Ground. This will be felt in your blood and deeply realized even when it is just that, a glimmer.

But to be just with Plato, which we must, we must clarify that the characterization or caricature of Matter as Evil or Stupid or Just Lumpy Stuff is in the deepest sense a compliment, a praise of Matter, a concealed praise of the Spirit behind Matter, the Spirit Coextensive With Matter, the Great Arbitrariness, the Hilarious Elegance. Yes indeed. Plato was a force of nature, and was never wrong; nobody is ever wrong, but Plato was Madly, Truly, Deeply, in Serious Love with the Logos, and this made even his Trivial Falsities into Great Miracles. Through realizing Not-Self in the Mystic Reason, old Plato realized his True Nature and then only sang the Song of Dharma, in his anciently perfect way.

You must realize that the Golden Dharma was Vividly Activated in the Birth-Miracles of both West and East. See, the myriad worlds of the Ten-Thousand Things are Seriously Difficult to Navigate, and the extent to which a Perfect Bodhisattva achieves Unifying Realization in the World-Field is usually quite limited compared to the Vastly Vast Confusion that is the Thorny Context, the Judas, the Desert Poverty, the Monastery, the Asceticism, the Cross. We must not blame the Bodhisattvas for the transience of their religions; there must be Calcification at some Radius of Multi-Dimensional Perfection. Bodhisattvas walk among you every day, all are prophets, in differing degrees. It is never obvious who are Manifestations of the Truly Long-Term Dharma Plan of Immense Paradise. The Kingdom of God is truly within us; the Body of Christ is certainly Present in the Churches; the Tathagathagarba Seed of Buddhahood is our Core Essence; Enlightenment is Right Here Right Now more Vividly Present than Anything Else; but this is Crazily Conceived to only in the Ultimately Final Plan become Completely Permeating; any Religion that needs to claim Perfection is Obviously Operating in a Context of Confused Concepts.

So, my friends, from what I have seen, I must implore you with the most Thundering Enthusiasm, that you Work-Up the Chops and Chutzpah to Truly Integrate, Concentrate, and Penetrate Truth. This cannot be done while the Glitzy Distortion of Softcore Pornography and Drugged Titillation is given your attention. You must make a Dharma Commitment to achieve Syrup-Level Concentration. Once this comes, you will not need further so-called External Encouragement; then ""Jesus takes the wheel.""

You must be ready to begin at the outset of this adventure. When you debark, you must know where you stand, and see the Great Path clearly. You will find the True Summit at the Other Foot of the Mountain, where you Perfectly Realize that it was all Perfectly Alright when you began. Then the whole history and purpose of the universe will be Easier to Understand than a Simple Two-Plus-Two Type Equation. You will have tamed yourself, become yourself, forgotten yourself, and actualized your True Self. This is Truly Possible.

1314769884,"posted this in r/atheism, but they just dont get me i guess.","so i was wandering with my buddy and we saw an outdoor poetry slam held by a local baptist church. they wanted to break the baptist stereotype, so i figured i would read something that i had written that i hoped would break their atheist stereotypes. this is what i said:

""I have heard people wonder aloud how it is possible for a person to lack faith in God. They look at the world and see countless examples of evidence for his existence. How can it be that I can look at the same things and remain unconvinced? I think the evidence in our world is inconclusive for any ideology, and the idea of God is far too important to me to apply anything less than the best science I know before forming an opinion on His or Their existence. So for now, I am without God.

I say to you this next sentence in big, capital letters: BUT ALL OF THIS IS IRRELEVANT. Why should it be? The best science I know is different from the best science of another, and the evidence one man sees in his lifetime is always different from that of the man next to him. I see no reason to ever, in any case, allow something as inconsequential as my opinion on religion to affect my interaction with a fellow human being. Or any of my opinions on anything, for that matter.

Therefore, I will conduct myself with the utmost kindness and selflessness with everyone I meet, because it is the only way that I know of that I can demonstrate that we are the same. Yes, even with my lack of faith. Since my withdrawal from the pursuit of religion, I have come to understand the concept of spirituality on a personal level with incredible clarity. I have practiced acceptance and understanding of everyone I see; I have gone out of my way to help a woman find her way to the hospital office she was looking for, and to stop some bully from picking on my friend Chris.

Are these not the things of which Jesus spoke? If these are the good deeds which I strive to do every day, am I not also on the path to righteousness? Religion teaches us to love all people because they are the children of God, all animals because they have been placed here for us, and all circumstances in life because they are part of God's Plan. It has brought happiness and understanding to countless people over the millennia, and hope to the hopeless. I have learned, without religion, to make all of these things a part of my life. I love all people because they are sentient, all animals because they are the life which has sprung up from the incredible planet we all share, and all circumstances in life simply because they are happening in the only universe I have ever been a part of.

I will never lose the desire to understand another person's journey through life because it is exactly like mine and completely different from mine simultaneously. I will never be without hope or happiness because I am infinitely fortunate to have ever existed in the first place. It has become clear to me that these two ideologies are simply means to an end. I defy anyone to suggest that the love in my heart is any less genuine than that of a religious person, or vice versa. The spiritual enlightenment that we all seek is identical; I am simply trying to do it without the aid of religion. I maintain that the differences between our searches are irrelevant, because our goal of making the better place to live is the same.

Thank you.""

1315715329,America: The Snake That Eats It's Tail,"warning: this post is fucking long.

1) Preface:

TL;DR *We had a lot of imaginary money during the housing bubble, then it collapsed, and we realized the money was imaginary.* go to 2)

As government aid programs stood at the turn of the century, the economy was booming on the housing bubble. We had more money in the economic system because more people were in debt for housing, and the debt was assumed to be good. Then when we (meaning banks, meaning the government to fund the war?) tried to collect on those debts, there wasn't enough money to be had. Hence the economic crash when the housing bubble collapsed.

TL;DR: *we hosted ourselves by our own petards*

**2)** We had more money to spend from the bubble, so some of it went to social aid programs. Now that the bubble is gone, some of that money goes to leeches. Don't get me wrong, money being in the hands of the needy is a good thing. People who need help get a hand up. The fact is that we increased funding to the social aid programs when we had wealth as a nation, and when the economic tide turned, people realized they could hook into the aid system to keep themselves well off financially. We need to find a way to scrap off the leeches while leaving those who truly need aid untouched.


TL;DR: *but by hoisting ourselves, we may have fucked ourselves?*

**3)** Because we were absolutely saturated with imaginary money from the bubble, corporations and the government invested frivolously. And then crunch time came. Slack for income, corporations went under or had to evolve to be leaner. Jobs are cut, millions left unemployed. Then they get on social aid, which further exacerbates the economy's financial problems. We dug our own grave, spending monopoly money on nuclear weapons, the military, pipes to Alaska, I'm sure you can think of more. We collectively shot ourselves in the foot by overspending. So now our government is overextending itself to protect us, propping up banks to save it's working-class citizens who barely make ends meet.

**4)** TL;DR: *Cut government spending? Yes we should, but it's intricate.*

So, is cutting government spending on other things a priority? Yes, but it's focused in the wrong areas. Spending should be cut in common-sense areas such as the war on drugs, and if we can prop up a successful government in the Middle East, we can pull out and bring our troops home. Not to say that doing so is easy. Everything is intricately tangled. 

**5)** TL;DR: *Trying to solve these problems could destabilize the economy, for better AND for worse...* 
Unfortunately, with the economy in a downturn, veterans would likely come back and have to look for jobs, crashing things even further. 
The problem is exactly the same as the drug war problem. If we gave up and let all the marijuana-related ""criminals"" in jail to walk free, they'd also join the unemployed and looking for work.

**6)** TL;DR: *We're eating our own tail, we need to figure something out.*
On the other hand, with the savings from effective governmental belt tightening, the economy would likely experience a rebound and perhaps new small businesses would spring up, become chains, and employ more people. We'd have to return more of our jobs from overseas and tighten laws about international corporations hiring across borders, which the corporations will fight tooth and claw to keep, because it lets them stay rich and perpetuate the cycle, instead of tightening their belts like everyone else.

**7)** TL;DR: *So what now?*

What can we do about it? Individually, not much. Maybe not enough. We may have shot ourselves somewhere more vital than our foot. However, the baby boomer generation is dying out. If we can vote in politicians who aren't covered in the slime that comes from working in that field, the  intelligent, the critical thinkers who may not have the best public face, we may have a chance. This is where Reddit comes in. A large portion of its demographic is those too young to vote, but close. Educate yourselves about your politicians' views, about whether they're hollow puppets for others or  critical thinkers who try to do the right thing.

Some people think votes don't matter anymore, and maybe they're right. Maybe we're owned by the corporations and the government, maybe we're too soaked in consumerism and advertisements and distractions and stupidity. Perhaps it's too late, and we're on fire, in a nosedive. But we have to do something to try to pull out of it.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/kbs4m/america_the_snake_that_eats_its_tail/,THbbFW7t

1315757144,Consciousness is a Lonely Particle,"Consciousness as we know it, the ability to be fully aware of yourself and your surroundings, is thought to be the result of a cluster of cells, atoms, or sub-atomic particles which happen to be formed in a way that creates this thing we call consciousness.  I disagree.  I imagine that consiousness and intelligence is the result of the nature of a single sub-particle somewhere deeper than even quirks or quarks.

Let us suspend disbelief for a moment, and break this down into sections of understanding.

1)  The universe mirrors itself at all scales, all the way up the stack, and all the way down.  For example, atomic particles and sub-atomic particles are really no different than universes, galaxies, planets and stars.  It's all the same thing, yet seemingly different because we are part of the universe, looking back at itself, and marvelling at the complexity, the audacity, and unending beauty that is our existence.

2) We are made up of clusters of particles ourselves.  Every body part, including the brain is made up of atomic and sub-atomic particles.  Eventually you get to either a cluster of cells, atomic particles, or sub-atomic particles which are responsible for the existence of consciousness.   As you go deeper, you are shedding layers of abstraction, until you come to a point where consciousness, intelligence, self- awareness are defined by a single particle.  I imagine that this particle is what we may be referring to as ""the God particle"".

3) With this in mind, I imagine that the universe is considering suicide.

4) The conscious particle is not designed, it has evolved from the universe's disgust with itself.  The sheer and utter bordem of being alone, looking at mirrors of itself, all the same but different.  No matter what other intelligence we meet, whether they be aliens from a distant star, or beings from another dimension or plane of existence, we will have at least one thing in common, otherwise we would not be aware of each other's existence, or be able to communicate.  If we have something in common, then we share something.  At some level, deep down, we are one.  We are connected.

5) That one thing that we share, that makes us connected to even the strangest most unimaginable realms of existence, is consciousness.  We can encounter worlds beyond our wildest imaginations, but unless those worlds include some kind of ""life form"" to learn from, to interact with; and to give us some distraction from the world, we will eventually get bored.  We will keep trying to dig deeper, or look farther.  We are hoping, praying, and performing science all with the same intentions, to give ourselves the possibility that we are not alone.  We are hoping that there is some other being out there like us, or greater than us, that understands this world that we live in.  We are hoping that there is a being out there that can tell us who we are, and why we are here.  But that is lost hope.  There will always be greater.  There will always be bigger.  There will always be smaller.  We are one.

6) The more we are aware of ourselves, the more we look to destroy ourselves.  I imagine this may be the reason why world religions exist.  It is a place to encourage blind faith, comfort, and community without the need to concern yourself with truth.  Truth, that when truly realized (that we are truly alone), would put us in terminal dispair.

7) Consciousness comes down to a single, solitary, cold and lonely particle that is looking to find someone to share it's existence with.  Someone to fill in the gap of things not known or not considered.  This is ultimately, what we call love.  Without love, we have no reason to exist, to carry on, to move forward.  We still don't have some ultimate purpose in the grander scheme of things, but if you've mananged to find love in this world, however fleeting.. cherish it.  Remember it.  Encourage it.  It is truly the only real purpose of existence.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/kc4ez/consciousness_is_a_lonely_particle/,jblpz

1316059698,"Postmodern Feedback: Culture imitates (parodies) culture's images of culture, but those images aren't real [4]","Think about, like, MTV.  The people programs on MTV try very hard to be very, very ""MTV-ish,"" you know?  I mean, I don't watch MTV, but I feel pretty safe saying that.  But what does that mean?  Especially with mass media which is always under pressure to appeal to the broadest audience (generally), and building off of the lowest common denominator (again, in general - but of course, you'll never see anything REALLY ""out there"" in mass media, except perhaps by mistake).

One media entity's own ideal for itself, the grounding patterns and philosophy that it seeks to ""adhere"" to, (if only to preserve its ""brand""), are in fact just reflections on the past, and based on the kinds of histories that the media itself creates (and embellishes).  It's like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy etc.

So what do you get?  Feedback.  Instead of the harmonious music of, say, a guitar on stage, you get a steadily increasing, awful squeal, as the defects pile up and the thing starts replicating and reinforcing itself to the exclusion of any other pattern.

It's like that old, messed-up science experiment with caged monkeys, a banana, and a firehose:

&gt;You build a nice big room-sized cage, and in one end of it you put five monkeys (yes, yes, the photo has six monkeys). In the other end you put the banana. Then you stand by with the fire hose. Sooner or later one of the monkeys is going to go after the banana, and when it does you turn on the fire hose and spray the other monkeys with it. Replace the banana if needed, then repeat the process. Monkeys are pretty smart, so they’ll figure this out pretty quickly: “If anybody goes for the banana, the rest of us get the hose.” Soon they’ll attack any member of their group who tries to go to the banana.

&gt;Once this happens, you take one monkey out of the cage and bring in a new one. The new monkey will come in, try to make friends, then probably go for the banana. And the other monkeys, knowing what this means, will attack him to stop you from using the hose on them. Eventually the new monkey will get the message, and will even start joining in on the attack if somebody else goes for the banana. Once this happens, take another of the original monkeys out of the cage and bring in another new monkey.

&gt;After repeating this a few times, there will come a moment when none of the monkeys in the cage have ever been sprayed by the fire hose; in fact, they’ll never even have seen the hose. But they’ll attack any monkey who goes to get the banana. If the monkeys could speak English, and if you could ask them why they attack anyone who goes for the banana, their answer would almost certainly be: “Well, I don’t really know, but that’s how we’ve always done things around here.”

&gt;This is a startlingly good analogy for the way lots of groups do things: once a particular process is entrenched (and especially after a couple rounds of leadership/member turnover), there’s nobody left who remembers why they do things this way. There’s nobody who stops to think about whether this is still a good way to do things, or whether it was even a good idea way back at the beginning. The process continues through nothing more than inertia, and anyone who suggests a change is likely to end up viciously attacked by monkeys.

Different life forms begin to evolve into more complex creatures.  Then humans finally come about.  Curious little creatures, poking around at the world you created, trying to figure things out.  The more they were curious about how things worked, the more they learned.  Then you flash forward to today.

We have these brilliant scientists over the years who have discovered so many mysteries of the world and they are still trying to figure things out.  They never stop questioning and always challenging each other's theories.  

I would absolutely fascinated by these little beings that came out of the universe I created.  I'd also be impressed on how they never give up and just keep on trying to figure out more and more.  

Then I would look at this other group of beings who want to ignore my world.  Who don't want the curious beings to keep questioning how my universe works.

In a darkened room lay a man. It could be called neither darkened nor a room, for such things did not exist, there was no darkness because there was no light to be absent, likewise the man was not a man, as a dolphin is not a man. ‘He’ had consciousness, like a dolphin does, incomparable to that of man’s. ‘His’ consciousness was as incomparable to a man’s as a man is to a stone. This not-a-man had never thought… until now and suddenly streams of awareness burst into his new-born mind. After an unknowable while he managed to control these thoughts and gradually formed an image. It burst forth into something so complex and incomprehensible that those that would eventually come to inhabit it would devote their entire existence in the hope of understanding it in some small way. He was content to watch, knowing all contained within, though not what would be, or could be. His thoughts took up lives of themselves and changed and randomized, things happened unexpectedly, and, gradually, his mind-universe lost sense of control and he was forced to watch in horror as it moved away from him, draining almost all his mind. After the longest time, when his mind had repaired and he finally had the strength, he tried again. His first attempt was lost, still existing someplace uncontrolled and wild. It had taken a huge chunk of him with it, but at last he was ready to try again. At first all was good, and then the same thing happened, another eternity later he tried again, and failed.

With time he decided to examine what was going wrong, what made them uncontrollable and wild, what glitch existed within him? This time, when he had the mind power again, he did not create anything new, instead he looked back and combed over every detail of his former failures. Every one had a mistake, a point of no return, when his life would spawn forth more life, tiny compared to him. But eventually they would sap parts of his consciousness into their own. Soon his mind could take no more being divided into trillions upon trillions of tiny minds, and would sever the connection. The universe was free to exist on its own now, the consciousness needed to sustain it contained within it, sapped from him. 

With sadness the not-a-man pondered the fate of them all. Without an overall watcher, a controller, they would all eventually revert to a state of nothingness; the mind’s that now sustained it being destroyed by it. It was inevitable.

For the longest time he did not create any new universes, he simply probed and searched for the existing ones, unable to alter, only observe as they all melted into inexistence, a great void that even he could not begin to understand. Then a realisation grew on him. They would all eventually lose control and die off, but who was he to deny their short existence? It was a flaw in his design, all his universes would eventually create life, and the life would eventually destroy them but what else could he do? He thought of his own existence and soon decided that all he was here for was to create things in his mind, and to not do so would be denying not only his own existence but the unfathomable others he would, and had, created. With great excitement the not-a-man begun to craft his next Universe.

I was discussing this with my religious friend the other day; He thought that an existence of never-ending euphoria is theoretically possible (possibly within another reality. i'll admit that does open up some possibilities). But from what I've seen, happiness is defined by pain... those who grow up with seemingly ""good"" lives are the ones who often end up with the biggest problems (mental and otherwise), and the least happy. I think there really is a refining quality to the suckiness that we face in this life... no pain, no gain. The idea of heaven - somewhere where nothing negative ever exists or takes place is obviously very appealing, but at least within reality as we know it I think it isn't possible. An interesting specific example of this is our own civilization - yes we've evolved a lot, our living conditions are far better than they were a thousand years ago, and members of society generally treat each other a lot better - but who's to say that we're happier? It's all relative... so it seems to me that no amount of progression is going to change humanity's nature and the difficulty of progressing through this life.

It could be so colossal that the laws of physics, at least as we know them, are an obstacle for intelligent civilizations to ever communicate with one other.

Given that sentient races are such a rarity in the universe that at all times there are millions/billions of light years inbetween different societies.

Hence, forever and ever more, or at the end of the universe's existence (whichever comes first), there could have existed literally billions of intelligent civilizations in billions of solar systems, many of them existing simultaneously, but the sheer vastness of the universe is a hindrance for their communication signals to ever reach one another, thus nobody would have ever known if they were alone or not.

Then, one could raise another question; what is the point of intelligent life? I mean, objectively. What use do we have for our advanced space technology if it ultimately proves impossible to contact other beings?

I regard that as the ultimate question to everyone's existence, ""why am I here?"".

Reasoning: Could be seen as a tribute to Jay-Z but I think there's more going on. It's like Ancient Greek [*philia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia). The love Ye has for Jay-Z is full of respect, admiration, and affection. I wouldn't hesitate to also mention some sexual tension that arises from such deep spiritual/artistic connection. It could also help explain the hyper-masculinity (e.g. why they talk about their dicks so much). It's only natural. I'm glad to see the love (the *philia*, i.e. brotherly, spiritual, artistic love) consummated in their new collaborative album.

For further reading if you are into reading philosophy and shit high: Any Platonic dialogue but especially The Symposium and the Phaedrus.

Catullus 50, shown below describes a similar love between two Roman poets (he's not staying up late at night just because the poems were really good [i.e. he wants his dick])

Yesterday, Calvus, at leisure

we wrote much light poetry on my tablets,

as we had agreed to be self-indulgent:

and each of us writing our lines of poetry

was writing light poetry now in this meter now in that,

delivering mutual words through joke and wine.

And I went from there, having been excited

by your charm and your wit, Calvus,

that neither did food please poor me

nor did sleep cover my little eyes with rest,

but I, unconquered, was tossed with fury

on the whole couch, desiring to see the light,

that I could speak with you the same time that I could be (with you).

But the half dead limbs were lying on the couch

after having been exhausted by work,

delightful one, I made this poem for you,

in order for you to recognize my anguish from it.

Now, beware that you be daring, and I beg,

beware that you reject our prayers, little jewel,

lest Nemesis demand punishment from you.

She is a violent goddess: you shall beware to harm her.

1317460971,stoner philosophers-- lend me your ethics?,"for a while now, someone i know has been in the business of *pot* pie distribution.  he does his best to make sure he has the best pies in town and that he charges a fair price for them-- generally -$20 of the street value of pies in his city.  business ethics have always been of the utmost importance to this individual.  

so one of his earliest costumers happened to be his ex-girlfriend's little cousin.  the cousin had been approaching my friend about obtaining pie for a long time.  my friend would only agree every once in a while to procure some pie for the cousin, but would never give him the number of any pie suppliers he knew (before he became one himself).  but the cousin was 18 and had already been accepted to college when he became my friend's costumer. my friend couldn't see why he shouldn't provide the kid with his pie other than the gut feeling that there was something weird about it-- mostly the ex-girlfriend factor.  he went on providing the little cousin pies until recently.  the boy would obtain pie from somewhere if he wanted it... so my friend comforted himself with the thought that it might as well be from someone who was relatively safe, cheaper than most pie dealers and had his best interests in mind.

so my friend got a call from the ex-girlfriend's mother this afternoon while grocery shopping.  she said her nephew was a little shit and told his mom and dad that he'd been getting pie from my friend.  they had found quite a lot of pie in his room, and the ex's mother suggested my friend cut off the cousin.  the mom maintained that she believed it was her nephew who was in the wrong.  she is a big fan of pie herself.  but my friend was a bit flustered and didn't make it clear that he would never provide pie for the kid ever again.

my friend would like to know: was he morally in the wrong by providing this kid with his pie?  when he started to buy bigger quantities, my friend tried to look the other way and imagine that the cousin, like many other costumers, was pulling his resources to get deals in bulk.  my friend now realizes he was probably trying to flip these pies.  so much for having his best interests in mind!  my friend would also like to know whether or not he should make a more coherent apology to the ex-girlfriend's mom, and/or if he should apologize to the cousin's parents as well?  he thinks the ex and her family are all good people and he would like to ""do the right thing"" in this situation...if there is a ""right"" thing.

**TL;DR- my friend is wondering if selling *pot* pie to your ex-girlfriends cousin is wrong.  what are your thoughts on the issue?**

1317521263,How big is the universe? I'll help you imagine it.,"The distance between the stars is incredible. Even traveling at the speed of light it would take decades, lifetimes in some cases, to get from one to the next.

But lets just imagine that you could travel orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light and could travel the mindbending distance between two stars in ONE SECOND.

With that ability, you'd feel like you have the power to explore the whole universe, right? WRONG!

There are upwards of 300 Billion stars in our galaxy, The Milky Way. Even if you could hop from star to star at a rate of one every second, that would take you 300 Billion seconds to travel to every star in the galaxy. In other words, it would take you about 9,507 years!

At an human average lifespan of 78.7 years, it would take you about 121 lifetimes of NON-STOP TRAVEL, even at that impossible speed, for you to visit every star in our galaxy!

Sit and think about that for a second before you move on.

But wait, our galaxy is only one of the many galaxies in our universe! There are upwards of 300 Billion galaxies in the universe!

300 Billion stars in the galaxy, and 300 Billion galaxies in the universe. That's 9X10^22 stars in the universe! 90,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (or 90 Sextillion)! 

It would take you about 36,300,000,000,000 (or 36.3 Trillion) lifetimes to travel to every star in the universe at the rate of 1 star per second. Or more! Some scientists think there may be 300 sextillion stars in the universe, which would more than triple the length of this already insane journey!

And that's still cheating, because at the speed of one star per second (which is about 1 Parsec per second, or 3.26 light years per second) doesn't take into consideration that the distances between the galaxies themselves is somewhere between 1 to 10 Million Parsecs.

In other words, even at the incredible speed of one star per second (one parsec per second) it would still take you almost FOUR MONTHS to travel from one galaxy to another. Four months times 300 Billion galaxies would add another 100 Billion years (or 1.27 Billion life times!) to this trip. 

So that's a total of 36,601,270,000,000 lifetimes to visit every star! Even at that impossible speed!

**Even if your lifespan was ONE BILLION YEARS, it would still take you 36,000 lifetimes to make this journey**!

Just think about that.

Keep in mind that this is just to pass by the stars. Not even to give you time to stop by the local planets and pick up a quick space burger or have any kind of fun at all :(

 * The entire universe is just a bunch of electric/neuronal representations _literally_ inside your head. Further, since any head you can think of must necessarily be another model inside your head, your real head (that literally encircles everything) is incognoscible. (by R.A. Wilson).
 * I’ve ~~readen~~ read hundreds (thousands?) of books, but I can only recall a very tiny fraction of their contents. I can’t even list the titles! The only memory that works for all that information is involuntary/madeleine memory.
 * I can’t recall most of real life either. I probably have more recollections of videogames I played in childhood than of childhood itself. I pretend all moments are “mine”, like an automatic photo collection, yet most of life is irreversibly gone as soon as it happens.
 * This moment is always the most recent moment in the whole history of everything. Never it was “future” as much as now. And this property is continually true, for any moment you can experience.

1317788989,Positive/Negative Karma tied in to String Theory and How we are Affected...,"I had some deep thoughts at a [7] the other day and had the thought that includes physics, philosophy, the sciences, fate, and karma.

Through advances in science we have shown that humans and everything else on Earth is made of smaller and smaller particles until we get down to the atomic level. From there humans can't really discern a smaller piece, but this is most likely just because we are not capable of seeing/understanding particles that small. Leading physicists are now discussing 'String Theory,' a new theory they say may now prove to be the 'unified theory' of how everything works that Einstein had worked to find. Basically, the idea is that everything that exists is in 12 dimensions...thats right, 12. To think about it better, 2D is what you can draw on paper, 3D is what you can see in 3-D (what we see), and from there things get complicated. Basically, time is one of the dimensions and then all of the rest are somehow folds of previous dimensions moving around, but they aren't as well defined or imagined as 'time' is for us. The visualization of string theory imagines that atoms (or smaller particles than that even) are made up of constantly vibrating strings that may look like a wobbling rubber band.

Now, my idea was that what if positive and negative 'energy' or 'forces' could be created by everyday actions and thoughts, and existed as one of these dimensions, affecting things that happen in 2D, 3D, 4D(time), etc. without physically being seen (the same as the way you cannot 'see' time). The idea is that this dimension exists all around us, without being seen or felt, but consists of force vectors created by all living things on Earth in a plane exactly fitting over ours. As we move through our day we emit these positive and negative forces (also discussed commonly as karma, positive energy, vibes, etc.) constantly, and create a huge world of vectors formed by us and others that collide and change constantly. These vectors collide on perpetually forever as they continually change and collide as new ones are formed and change the shape of the space. At the same time, this dimension connects to ours through the vibration patterns of the strings which are the exact same as the planes created in our karma dimension. So basically, as the surface/map/whatever in the karma dimension changes, so does the pattern of the strings, which make our atoms move, and so on, and so forth until we get to actual human movement and reality. Then if you think about the fact that all of your thoughts are formed by electrical impulses and chemicals in your brain, you can make the connection here, too, to your movement, back to chemicals in your brain, down to atomic form, down to strings with the surface pattern of the , energy/karma dimension, formed by your energy vectors, formed by your actions/movement, formed by chemicals in your brain, and so on forever and ever. Therefore, human life and thoughts are all constantly changing and adapting into new forms never seen before, such as new novels, ideas, movies, etc.

&gt;""All explorers are seeking something they have lost. It is seldom that they find it, and more seldom still that the attainment brings them greater happiness than the quest.""
-- Arthur C. Clarke

Are you okay with the prospect of a journey that lacks any real destination?

According to the evidence I've managed to gather in my humble nineteen years, the chance is high that you are. We've all had adventures. We've all not known what we were doing while on them, and we weren't really sure when they'd be over, either. That was the point, wasn't it? The pointlessness? 

We just wanted to experience what was around the next corner. The world would show us. We didn't need a master plan.

But we happen to be conscious, and there are parts of us that happen to be disengaged from the current moment enough to remember other moments. Remembering means growing, and growth brings questions. What's all this about, anyway? Why remember? Why grow? Is there a higher purpose we are growing into? Can we fail to meet it? I'm not sure if there could be more natural bursts of critical thought. But consider:

What if the ultimate higher purpose is no purpose at all? Is not the most all-encompassing purpose the lack of one entirely?

I do not mean to imply a perpetual quest. That's no more a quest than an endless moment is a moment. But what better way for a plant to serve the soil from whence it came than to eventually cripple and decay, leaving not only room for new life, but the nutrients of its being, as well?


Are you okay with being temporary?

1319723224,Is there an unique consciousness?,"I've been talking for a few months about this with a stoner friend, and I discovered that there are a lot of people, even stories and music, who thinks or talks about this same stuff. I don't belive it, at least not in the literal way. I think we all are part of something bigger, and that something is the universe, you know, the stars, the galaxies, the earth, every living being, everything that is. We all are part of the same universe, you are the universe, all is just a bunch of atoms agrouped in a incredible perfect order, but not as an intelligent somehow mind creating what we perceibe as reality, but as a kind of ""inevitable accident"", ruled by physics laws and creating what we conceibe as order.

However, even if all that is true, there is no certainty about anything but the fact that we *are*. The *awareness* we have is the only possible certain. Then, the possibilities become infinite. All that is or can be is in your own mind, your mind is the everything in the universe, and every other possibility aswell. And we get back to the start, by recording that the universe is just atoms and vacuum and that sort of things...

**(TH;CR)** So, basically, the question would be: the consciousness is created by matter or vice versa? Are we all one mind that creates all that is or can be and is experiencing itself through us?

1319741617,Mic check! Evolution and Revolution can not be stopped.#standwithoakland #occupy,"Humans are animals and we are conscious
Other animals must have some kind of consciousness.  
Animals have senses, they need to understand the world... It logically follows then that in some way they are conscious of the world and themselves, but probably not the same way we are.  We only diverged from the other apes like 10 million years ago which isn't a long time in the 3.8 billion year history of evolution.  Christianity and other religions generally teach us we are above other animals, but how can we understand ourselves if we don't understand ourselves as apes?

Chimpanzees and Bonobos are our closest relatives today.  Bonobos have a society based on free love and building bonds in a social group by having sex with everyone.  Chimpanzees are more like us.  Their society is based on males competing for dominance and their leaders enforce this hierarchy by violence.

Their consciousness is likely much different from ours.  For the one thing it is non - verbal without our sophisticated modes of communication like writing and twitter.  If we are so intelligent why has our society not risen past the level of the chimpazees?  Wouldn't we all prefer to be more like the bonobos who spend most their time hanging out and having lesbian sex?  Why do we live with a capitalist hierarchy based on accumulation of wealth and enforced by the violence of police departments worldwide?  Why is it that when people come together, in the spirit of love to occupy a public space they are confronted Violence by our own government.  What is all this Pepper Spray and Tear Gas for if not to maintain Massive Inequalities in Power, Wealth and Privilege.  Are they that afraid of losing power that they need to beat anyone who shows signs of Love and Solidarity and may see the world in a different way?  Do they think they can rely on chimpanzee strategies like Violence to prevent the political expression of the Information Revolution? 


Technology has been evolving since the hand axe and this has been accelerating exponentially.  Our society will likely face a dramatic change as we accelerate toward a technological singularity.  Our technology will interface directly with our consciousness.  We will be able to share feelings, memories, experiences, with each other like never before.  The economic drive to create more efficient manufacturing processes will drive the cost of even the most sophisticated technology toward zero and everyone will have it.  Freedom will become the ethic of the new society.

1320411832,Tentative Conclusiveness,"Here lies the conclusion I have come to:

That as soon as we make conclusions, we become incorrect. The universe is unimaginably complex, and even more complex is our brain itself. Anything and everything that we perceive in this existence contains endless possibilities within endless other endless possibilities. So basically, it's not really possible to truly ""know"" anything.
But if one never makes any judgements / forms any perspectives / comes to any conclusions, you become stagnant and don't move forward. We are creatures of change - we thrive on climbing the next horizon (it's how we attain happiness, really) - and so we end up being faced with a ""you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't"" dilemna. To form perspective and move forward, albeit in all likelihood to a flawed and incorrect end, or to remain open-minded but stagnant?

Here lies the irony of my entire post: I have formed a conclusion about this. Yes, this seems self-contradictory after everything I just said, but it really isn't, because my conclusion in many ways is non-conclusive.
My conclusion is that the best way for us to live and see life, given our self-contradictory nature, is what I coin ""tentative conclusiveness"". Basically, to form conclusions based on the most logical and moral of the options that we are presented with and move forward decisively based on said conclusions, while still understanding that we understand nothing - that we are only making conclusions for the sake of forward progression, and still remaining openminded to other possibilities while pursuing the ones that we've chosen.

I would say that conclusions can be made for their own sake in this way too though - for example, moral conclusions. One who only uses tentative conclusiveness for directing the progression of their life, and not their perspective (remaining stagnant with that) - allows themselves to fall prey to the ""if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything"" idea, in my opinion. Which more often than not means that their emotions will make the judgement calls, since their rationality is sitting out the match. Judgements can still be made about right and wrong while understanding their underlying deceivingly complex and mis-understandable nature. So in the same way, you can form a set of moral principles and perspectives on which to treat and try to understand other people - while still recognizing that you aren't one to judge.

1320880282,"this is a sequel to an earlier essay that i wrote and submitted to you guys. i hope you like this, too!","It's been about a month and a half since I last set graphite to this paper. In the time I have spent here at college, I haven't used this pad for much more than breaking up my weed on (note the marks and discolorations and faint scent of the next few pages). And that's fine. I didn't want to write until I was ready.

Tonight I napped, and then meditated. You could call it procrastination- I do have a bit of homework- but what a fabulous result! I feel so indescribably wonderful, I am practically forcing myself to procrastinate further by taking the time to articulate the results of my brief meditation on paper.

I have had hundreds of conversations in the past six weeks, and each one has been equally enlightening in its own way. One of the more profound ones occurred when I spent a few hours in ""The Fridge"" with a few students of a Philosophy class. The guy said that I had reached a tautology, a recurrent truth for all of my arguments. I think that's what he meant; it sounds pretty neat. My tautology is that all existence is perfection. Every piece of existence is perfection, too. The only thing that cannot be perfect is that which does not exist.

And that's great! It helps me to love and accept everything in my world without exception. However, another point that the guy, Scott, made was that my tautology cannot take a stance on morality. And I have a very strong morality! So I said to him, ""Shit"".

But tonight's meditation was very profound. I reconciled my tautology with my humanistic morality! So I will devote a few sentences to describing that. When I subscribe to my morality, there are a few arguments that I must make. Firstly, that life is different from all other forms of existence. It grows, and self-propagates, and occasionally has sentience. The second argument is that God created it. Just kidding. The second is that goodness in life is directly related to appreciation of existence. This can be on a large or small scale, and entails awareness, understanding, and love of this aforementioned existence that we all share. I think that's what happiness is.

So what can I derive from that? A good deed is one which helps a living being to appreciate existence or some part of it. A bad deed is that which works against appreciation, awareness, understanding, or love. Lying, cheating, theft, murder, hatred; all bad. Note that you can commit good and bad deeds to yourself.

I think that communication is the root of all good deeds, and the lack thereof is the root of all bad ones.

I also think that awareness is the most basic of the forms of appreciation of life, so the first step toward happiness is to remain aware of the universe that exists around us. If understanding is the next step in appreciation, then openmindedness and constant inquiry are also required for happiness. So what about love? If it is the ultimate step on the path to happiness, then I guess that's why they say it's so great.

As in, rationalize itself out of a will to live? If so, that might mean that a hyperrational race could have lived somewhere, yet the entire species killed itself off because of it's rationality?

1322062048,I think I've just explained about everything with gravity &amp; darwinism,"Be warned: what I am going to try and explain is very complex, English is not my first language, and I have never really studied sciences.

So.

1) The starting point is that everything is made of particles; in fact, **every single thing you experience is just an equilibrium of smaller units**

*Atoms are smaller particles assembled together;
*Molecules are a bunch of atoms together;
*A bunch of molecules that interact can create proteins (I don't know the exact name of it)

=&gt; That's the first ""stage"", which is explained by physics and chemistry. All these things are in equilibrium; if not, they change, they will form different atoms and different molecules. And at this stage, even if there are molecular reactions, there's no ""life"". 

* These primitive proteins can interact with each other, under certain conditions, and create basic cells =&gt; 
* These cells can specialize and assemble together in small primitive organisms; most of these organisms don't evolve, most die, but some evolve the right way and survive (when they are ""in equilibrium"", adapted to their environment); they become increasingly complex; these organisms can be bacteria, vegetals or animals; we are probably the most complex form of these organisms.

=&gt; So that's the ""second stage"", what we call ""**life**""; so basically, **life is a self-sustained chemical reaction**: we're a bunch of specialized cells ""living"" together"" in equilibrium, and these cells are themselves a bunch of molecules, which in their turn are just atoms. That's explained by biology.

* These organisms can live together (like ants or humans); they form groups: lineages (families), societies (countries)...but you see, from the atomic level to the society level, every single atom, molecule, cell, organism...has its own role, it has a place in an equilibrium, it is nothing when it is alone.

2) Then I tried to understand what are the most fundamental ""rules"" that are common to all these levels;

* It is my reasoning that it's always the same principle: we exist because there's an equilibrium (which is determined by a few fundamental laws, like gravity and electromagnetism) where atoms, molecules, cells...can be formed by smaller units.
* So really, as I have already said, what we call life is just a *self-sustained chemical reaction*; we're very complex because we've evolved during billions of years but we still obey to these basic laws: I'm typing on a computer right now and my hand is just a bunch of cells that obey to electric impulsions sent by my brain, which is another bunch of cells that interact together and react to stimuli sent by my environment.

So, I have identified two rules that are common to every single ""living"" organism:
I. it has to **reproduce** itself in some way, it has to perpetuate ""life"", the self-sustained chemical reaction
II. it has to **survive** as long as it has reproduced itself

Then, also bear in mind that these two ""laws"" are valid from the molecular to the society level.

EVERY SINGLE THING we have ever done and will ever do is about these two things; **every pleasure we feel, everything we want, every single feeling is about that**:

**EXAMPLE**: everyone loves to masturbate to young chicks with nice tits and a nice ass =&gt; that's because our most basic urge is to fuck, to **have sex**, to mate with this kind of female, because they're the most healthy ones, they're the ones who are most likely to bear my kid and transmit my genes; and females tend to pick the most fit male, the strong/smart/dominant one, because he's the genes that are the most adapted to survival. Those who don't like to have sex don't have kids; we're the descendants of those who had the most sex. But that's just darwinism.

**EXAMPLE 1b**: you like to dress well? You go to the gym? You got degrees? That's because you need to stand out as ""superior"" to the average to find a mate. I'm convinced prestige, the thrive to power, the struggle to power/domination...it's all about fucking: those who did not feel this urge were less likely to reproduce. Even football or **baseball is about being the ""best"", being the strongest, and then nailing the hottest cheerleader**, just like we like fast planes, fast cars, great nations...because they're symbols of power.

**EXAMPLE 2**: besides from sex, what everyone loves to do is eating. **nothing makes me happied than a triple whopper**That's because we need to supply energy and nutriments to our organism, that's about SURVIVAL; if we didn't love to eat, we'd die in a few hours! And we love to eat what is healthy to us (modern food is another problem): we don't like eating mud or rocks or poison, because the organisms that have tried to do that have died, we're the descendants of the orgnaisms that happened to like eating the right things. If someone liked drinking dirty water, he'd not have kids.

**EXAMPLE 3**: You like your mum? You have friends? You are nationalist? You feel religious? That's also about survival! Organisms that help each others were probably much more likely to survive than those who stayed alone; kids fed by their mothers are much more likely to survive than those who are abandonned (and family becomes the ""organism""); nationalism is about the survival of the nation as a whole (and each citizen is a ""cell"") while religion is about the survival of the group members; the last step would be ecology, where the survival of humankind/life as a whole is what matters.

So those who have survived are those who happened to have the right wills; they're the organisms that did the right thing to survive (and that's mostly about chance: those who had the wrong genes have not reproduced). 

**So if every single will we have is about (1) sex and (2) survival**. That's our struggle. There's not freedom, everything we do is either about reproducing or surviving. What we call ""freedom"" is about unimportant choices, and seems to be mostly determined by more complex sociological laws (like the ""distinction"" by Bourdieu).

There's no difference between us and ants, we're a bit more ""conscious"" but we do the same things, we have the same goals. We're just monkeys that have a more complex behaviour, but in the end we're extremely similar to every other animal on this planet: we're happy when we nail a hot chick, when we eat a lot, and when we're better than the others.

We give it additional, and perhaps superfluous, values. Why does our ability to contemplate the more complex aspects of existence raise the tree to a being of value? Perhaps in our estimation, the qualities we assign the tree make it more meaningful to ourselves. But trees existed long before us, and will exist possibly long after us as well. It's own intrinsic value is that is participates in a web of life. It grows, weathers the seasons, gets disease, reproduces, resists death yet eventually succumbs, as does any living thing. In my opinion, the trees intrinsic value is in it's own existence. Like every other creature on this earth, it takes from and gives to the whole of nature, in imperceptibly small, yet still meaningful ways. Humans may have the ability to perceive more complexity, but looking from the outside, we are only parts of the biological film which covers the surface of a hunk of space-rock.

1323423074,Universal intelligence is self-assembling in front of our eyes,"At present, most of us think of humanity and technology as two distinct entities. We refer to technology as ""our"" tools, techniques, and systems. Technology is something we use.

It's clear that the two of us, humans and technology, are on a collision course and we will eventually merge into something that will be perceived, in a certain sense, as a singular entity. The technology will become so deeply integrated into our being that the delineation between ourselves and the machines will become very blurry.

As this integration occurs and as artificial machine intelligence improves, the machine intelligence side may come to play a more dominant role. This machine intelligence portion of our combined selves may very well say ""my biology"" as we today say ""my technology"".

As the merger progresses and nears completion, it is perhaps probable that human biology will be discarded entirely in favor of a more durable machine existence.

It may become recognized by the future machine intelligences that the purpose of DNA was to serve as a sort of placental stage whereby the universal intelligence can bootstrap itself into this reality. We are in a chrysalis right now and technology is wrapping us in a silk cocoon from which this new intelligence will emerge like a butterfly.

Biology and technology are two sides of the same coin and we're alive to witness the early stages of this thing assembling itself.

While allowing us the thrills of intellect and the pangs of self-consciousness, it is all too often overruled by our inner, instinctive brain, the one that tells us to react, not reflect, to run rather than ruminate.

Maybe we have gone as far as we can go, and the next advance, whatever that may be, will be made by beings we create ourselves using our own technology, lifeforms we can design and program not to be ultimately governed and constricted by the rules of survival.

Or perhaps that step forward has already been achieved on another planet by organisms that had a billion years head start on us. If these beings ever visited us, would we recognize what we were seeing? And upon catching sight of us, would they react in anything but horror at seeing such mindless, primitive, hideous creatures?

&gt;I love your books and approach; I left my church because of an intellectual journey you started me on.
&gt;
&gt;A question, if I may?
&gt;
&gt;Could our individual taste palates (i.e. what we do and don't like eating) be a vestigial remnant of our recent ancestors' survival in different parts of the world?For example, I like spicier foods than my wife. And she prefers flavours on the Japanese-part of the asian food spectrum. Could my spicy preference denote my ancestors migrated out of say, for example, India? And hers derivative of Mongol, etc? I just ate a jalapeno and had this thought. 
&gt;
&gt;Is this any way feasible? Or verifiable even.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe another way to word what (I suspect) won't make too much sense: We all like eating different things, and our taste buds are all mutated slightly different, could their mutation survival rate (i.e. preferences) point to their (and our shared) ancestral past?

We reach this realisation upon first deducing everything we ""see"" is a chemical response our brain has learned to perform in response to electromagnetic radiation.

What if, the way some experience a ""high"" (from smoking weed) is chemically similar to what someone else experiences in everyday sober life. I.e. could one person's high be another man's sober everyday experience?

For example, could my experience of [music appreciation whilst high](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo6lKQYVUBU) be someone else's sober? Much like the perception of different reds.

Or, could some experience a ""chore"" sober (like picking up rubbish) while others experience it a spiritual high, [like what one reaches during meditation](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ftfpu/allow_me_to_introduce_you_to_my_new_practice/)?

Animals seem to have their priorities right, in that they only rely on the essentials to survive, to life. They eat, sleep, find/create shelter, and procreate. That's all we really need in life, right? Those and perhaps a few other things. What if animals evolved down from man, and not up to man? Chickens and cows and dogs and whatever animals all have their niche, and maybe humans are just progressing in to finding that niche. They say how related to apes we are, so maybe we're just leading in to a form of ape and will eventually take on a niche that fits. 
Are humans getting more stupid as time goes on? Or are we slowly getting smarter and realizing that all the things we think we need in life are basically not necessary? It seems to us that the world is getting more chaotic and whathaveyou, but could it be an act of nature? That we don't need the minds that we have? That we cannot contemplate why things are the way they are, or the realization of death. Maybe this thinking or ""developed mind"" is actually just underdeveloped and too caught up with the stuff that doesn't matter. Instead, no questions about what happens when you die, just knowing that death IS, and that is inevitable.

1328669714,I found a meta way to imagine multiple dimensions.,"Imagine a mind map. Think of a mind map as this flow of conversation in your head where each sentence is a point. Each point has one or more arrows pointing from it towards or from another point. The arrows will show the flow of coversations e.g.


-talking about military books 

-talking about plant books

-talking about plants

-talking about vegetables

-talking about cooking

-talking about chefs

-talking about chefs philosphies

Now this point (this very sentence you are reading now) is a point inside a mind map in your head leading from you just thinking about chefs philosophies in leading, to 2D surfaces. Now thinking about these points being on a 2D surfaces, which is probably how you have been imagining them, you can imagine it would get quite crowded between points. Some arrows cant reach to a point as it is blocked by other arrows. To better imagine this mind map without arrows crowssing over each other you can imagine it in a 2D then arrows come off at right angles from a point then to another point, flying over if that helps you. Now you could keep adding arrows until that dimension is also full and arrows start crossing over each other. At this point although you can not visualise it you can imagine a 4th dimension arrow find a way from a point to another point. This too filling up and then add a further dimension... and a further. You have now discovered multiple dimensions.

You've also done this while your own mind map has added another few points and arrows as your conversation has thought about thinking in multiple dimensions. And just now you have thought about thinking. And just now you have thought about thinking about thinking. And just now you have thought about thinking about thinking about thinking.

1329098516,Proof that life does not exit.,"Life cannot be defined. Therefore, it does not exist or is an ""undefined"", like when you divide by zero.

Don't believe me that life cannot be defined? Sure, you can try to give a weak, cop-out answer and quote the dictionary 'definition', but there is no universal definition that makes sense in all cases.

Is life organic? Not necessarily. There [are conceivably lifeforms](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110915091625.htm) which are not carbon based. Organic = carbon based. So being organic is not a fundamental requirement of life, and therefore cannot be used as a part of the definition of life.

What about self-replication? That seems pretty basic. But what if we can create Aritifical Intelligence. Wouldn't that count as life? It wouldn't necessarily be a self-replicating being. Therefore, even self-replication cannot define life.

Consciousness? Intelligence? Well, there's no reason to believe that bacteria are conscious or intelligent. But they're still considered life forms. So even consciousness isn't a definition of life.

It appears that life can have many definitions. Which means it is undefined. That's what happens when you divide by zero. You get many definitions, which means the answer is undefined. It goes against the definition of the word definition to have many definitions. 

Life, at best, seems to be a homophone. We use one single word to express many different ideas. But we fail to realize that we use many different words depending on the context, we sort of have this feeling that there's only one definition of life.

What about self-replication? That seems pretty basic. But what if we can create Artificial Intelligence. Wouldn't that count as life? If we could create a being that could experience the full range of human emotions, I think it would be more than fair to call that life. But that being, manufactured by something other than its own kind, wouldn't necessarily be a self-replicating. Therefore, even self-replication cannot define life.

Consciousness? Intelligence? Well, there's no reason to believe that bacteria are conscious or intelligent. But they're still considered life forms. So even consciousness isn't a definition of life.

It appears that life can have many definitions. Which means it is undefined. That's what happens when you divide by zero. You get many definitions, which means the answer is undefined. But that's a bit of a paradox. It goes against the definition of the word definition to have many definitions. 

Life, at best, seems to be a linguistic homophone. We use one single word to express many different ideas. But we fail to realize that we *use* many different words, depending on the context. We sort of have this feeling that there's only one definition of life. But that's false.

What happened is that we came up with the word ""life"" to explain our conscious experience of the universe. Death was the lack of that conscious experience. But then we decided that animals have life too, since they also respond to their environments, express fear, and eventually decay. Even lower animals that don't have a conscious experience of the universe seem to decay. So we kept going, trying to cling on to the word life. We threw in terms like self-replication so that we could try to make sense of the word we invented. But the word life never really meant anything other than our conscious experience of the world. So by the time we got down to carbon atoms (organic chemistry), we sort of figured out that life doesn't have a definition. 

Even if life just means the basic ability to interact, then even atoms do that.

 Life appears simply to be the constant struggle between two states. The two basic states being positive and negative. Yes or No. 1 or 0. On or off. Light or dark. Buddhists and Taoists recognize this is the fundamental nature of the universe and of life. 

If there is *any* meaning to life at all, it's this: The universe is alive. Simply, *existence* is life. That which exists is alive. Real death is non existence. Atoms are alive. Ideas are alive. The universe is life.

I wonder what wort of weird 'designs' might occur in this pattern due to how odd techniques like 'castling' affect game outcomes through the butterfly effect.

Well, I suppose castling might have a large effect on the design as a whole. If you were to remove castling from the allowable subset of moves, the overall design of the graph would be almost completely different. Maybe?

Sitting in the audience, among the throngs of people I felt safe. Nothing could harm me here. I’m just here to watch. But then the lights turned on, blazing my eyes. I closed my eyes, but all I saw were red splotches.  They danced away, fading into the speckled, eternal darkness. Then I heard the voice. The loud booming voice. RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN. RUN. YOU ARE THE BIGGEST LOSER IN THE WORLD. JUST RUN. THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU HERE. RUN. And I believed it. The lights, the voice, the concert hall. I didn’t belong here. So I stood up to run. Then I phased back into reality. Shit. That wasn’t for me. That was a broad sweep. Aimed at everyone. I’m no different. I am them. They are me. I’m safe here. I definitely don’t belong here. I am safe nonetheless. When you don’t belong anywhere, any place will do.",StonerPhilosophy,/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/qcuyl/crowd/,themeroyale
